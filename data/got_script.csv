70,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.

74,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robb Stark,What is it?
75,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Theon Greyjoy,"The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow."
76,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you"
77,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,"And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
78,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
79,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,What if Jon Arryn told someone?
80,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,But who would he tell?
81,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,My husband.
82,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
83,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,You should be the Hand of the king.
84,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
85,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
86,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
87,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,I wonder if the old gods agree.
88,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,It's your gods with all the rules.
89,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"I am so sorry, my love."
90,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Tell me.
91,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
92,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Your sister. The boy …
93,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
94,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after."
95,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"You can always say no, Ned."
96,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
97,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Maester Luwin,I'm told he drinks all night.
98,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
99,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Luwin,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
100,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"In any case, candles."
101,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
102,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Theon Greyjoy,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
103,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robb Stark,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
104,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Theon Greyjoy,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
105,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robb Stark,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
106,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
107,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Bran Stark,I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
108,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,How many times have I told you
109,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Bran Stark,But he's coming right now! Down our road!
110,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,I want you to promise me
111,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Bran Stark,I promise.
112,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,D'you know what?
113,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Bran Stark,What?
114,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
115,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
116,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
117,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Arya Stark,Move!
118,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Your Grace.
119,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,You've got fat.
120,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Cat!
121,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,Your Grace.
122,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
123,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
124,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Arya Stark,Where's the Imp?
125,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,Will you shut up?
126,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?"
127,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Arya Stark,Arya.
128,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
129,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Arya Stark,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
130,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,Would you please shut up.
131,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,My queen.
132,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,My queen.
133,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
134,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
135,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Ned.
136,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
137,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
138,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
139,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,We both did.
140,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
141,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Aye.
142,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
143,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,I'm not worthy of the honor.
144,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
145,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
146,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
147,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,I did hear something about that.
148,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
149,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,And the other brother?
150,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,The queen has two brothers?
151,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
152,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,I hear they call him the Imp.
153,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,I hear he hates that nickname.
154,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
155,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,Clever girl.
156,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
157,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,Have you?
158,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,The gods gave me one blessing.
159,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,Don't get up.
160,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Ros,M'lord.
161,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
162,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
163,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
164,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
165,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
166,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
167,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,Close the door!
168,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
169,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
170,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,She belonged with me.
171,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
172,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
173,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Not all of them.
174,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Daenerys!
175,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
176,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
177,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
178,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,No.
179,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
180,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Maid,"It's too hot, my lady."
181,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Where is he?
182,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
183,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,"May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
184,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,"Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
185,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,"Come forward, my dear."
186,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Where's he going?
187,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,The ceremony is over.
188,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
189,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
190,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
191,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,When will they be married?
192,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
193,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Is it true they lie with their horses?
194,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
195,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Do you take me for a fool?
196,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
197,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
198,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
199,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
200,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't know.
201,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
202,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
203,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
204,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,He's so handsome.
205,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
206,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
207,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
208,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
209,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
210,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,Sansa…
211,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
212,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,Is he dead yet?
213,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,Uncle Benjen!
214,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
215,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
216,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
217,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,So take me with you when you go back.
218,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,Jon…
219,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
220,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
221,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,I'm ready to swear your oath.
222,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
223,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,I don't care about that.
224,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,"You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
225,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
226,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,What're you doing back there?
227,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
228,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
229,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
230,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
231,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
232,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
233,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jon Snow,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
234,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
235,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
236,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
237,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,"Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
238,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
239,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,The two he was with are still missing.
240,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,A wildling ambush.
241,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
242,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Winter is coming.
243,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robb Stark,Uncle Benjen.
244,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Benjen,Robb boy. How are ye?
245,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robb Stark,I'm good.
246,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
247,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,Yes. Lovely country.
248,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
249,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
250,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
251,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,You're tall. Still growing?
252,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,"I think so, Your Grace."
253,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,And have you bled yet?
254,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,"No, Your Grace."
255,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,And your dress. Did you make it?
256,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,Such talent. You must make something for me.
257,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
258,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,I hear the same.
259,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
260,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Your pardon.
261,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
262,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
263,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
264,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,I don't fight in tournaments.
265,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,No? Getting a little old for it?
266,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
267,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,Well said.
268,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sansa Stark,Arya!
269,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robb Stark,Time for bed.
270,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
271,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,I won't let him take you.
272,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
273,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
274,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,How did he get so fat?
275,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
276,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,A Voice,"It's Maester Luwin, my lord."
277,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Send him in.
278,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Luwin,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
279,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,Stay.
280,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
281,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,What news?
282,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
283,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
284,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
285,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Luwin,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
286,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
287,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Luwin,"The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
288,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Catelyn Stark,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
289,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Luwin,A different time. Different king.
290,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
291,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
292,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,When?
293,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,When their omens favor war.
294,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
295,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
296,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jorah Mormont,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
297,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
298,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jorah Mormont,"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
299,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Illyrio,"Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
300,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you, Magister."
301,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,"She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki."
302,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jorah Mormont,There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
303,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Viserys,Make him happy.
304,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Khal Drogo,No.
305,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,Do you know the Common Tongue?
306,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Daenerys Targaryen,Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
307,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sandor Clegane,"Rough night, Imp?"
308,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
309,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sandor Clegane,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
310,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Tyrion Lannister,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
311,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Sandor Clegane,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
312,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
313,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,"No, but I'm still better than you."
314,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
315,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Eddard Stark,I hope I'll serve you well.
316,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Robert Baratheon,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
317,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Bran Stark,"Come on, you."
318,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,Stop. STOP.
319,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,Are you completely mad?
320,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,He saw us.
321,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,It's all right. It's all right.
322,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Cersei Lannister,He saw us!
323,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,"I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
324,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Bran Stark,Ten
325,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,Ten.
326,2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,Jaime Lannister,The things I do for love.
327,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jorah Mormont,"You need to drink, child... And eat."
328,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Isn't there anything else?
329,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jorah Mormont,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
330,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,Khaleesi!
331,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Irri,Your hands.
332,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jorah Mormont,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
333,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Viserys Targaryen,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
334,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jorah Mormont,"As you wish, your Grace."
335,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Viserys Targaryen,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
336,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jorah Mormont,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
337,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Viserys Targaryen,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
338,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
339,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
340,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,What good will my sympathies do them?
341,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
342,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
343,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,One word and I'll hit you again.
344,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,I'm telling mother!
345,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
346,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,You can't...
347,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,Do you understand?
348,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sandor Clegane,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
349,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
350,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
351,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,Little brother.
352,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,Beloved siblings.
353,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Myrcella Baratheon,Is Bran going to die?
354,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,Apparently not.
355,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,What do you mean?
356,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,The Maester says the boy may live.
357,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
358,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
359,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
360,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
361,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
362,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
363,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
364,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
365,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
366,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
367,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
368,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Please.
369,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
370,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
371,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I never knew.
372,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
373,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I am grateful..
374,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
375,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,A sword for the wall?
376,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,I already have one.
377,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
378,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Of course I have.
379,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
380,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
381,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
382,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Soon enough.
383,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jaime Lannister,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
384,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
385,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,It's good you've got help.
386,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
387,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Impressive.
388,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
389,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
390,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,A present?
391,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
392,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,It's so skinny.
393,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
394,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,I can be quick.
395,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
396,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,I think so.
397,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,First lesson
398,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,I know which end to use.
399,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
400,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
401,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
402,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,You've said it.
403,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
404,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I want you to leave.
405,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
406,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,I have no choice.
407,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
408,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,You can. You must.
409,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
410,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,You Starks are hard to kill.
411,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,My mother?
412,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,She was very kind.
413,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
414,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,It was always my color.
415,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,"Farewell, Snow."
416,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,"And you, Stark."
417,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
418,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
419,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
420,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
421,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,I've half a mind to go with you.
422,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
423,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
424,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
425,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,I recall a few chances.
426,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
427,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Bessie. She was one of yours.
428,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
429,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Wylla.
430,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
431,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Nor will I.
432,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
433,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
434,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
435,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
436,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
437,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,She's little more than a child.
438,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
439,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Tell me we're not speaking of this.
440,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
441,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
442,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
443,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
444,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
445,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
446,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
447,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Benjen Stark,Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
448,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
449,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Why do you read so much?
450,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.
451,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Is this a trick?
452,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
453,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,Until your brother killed that King.
454,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
455,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
456,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
457,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jon Snow,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
458,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
459,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Maester Luwin,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
460,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,Talk to Poole about it.
461,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Maester Luwin,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
462,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I don't care about appointments!
463,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
464,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Maester Luwin,"Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
465,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,When was the last time you left this room?
466,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I have to take care of him.
467,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
468,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
469,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
470,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
471,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
472,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Assassin,You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
473,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,No!
474,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Have you ever seen a dragon?
475,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Irri,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
476,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Everywhere? Even in the east?
477,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Irri,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
478,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jhiqui,It is known.
479,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
480,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,The moon?
481,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
482,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Irri,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
483,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
484,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
485,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,How old were you?
486,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
487,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Nine?!
488,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
489,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
490,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,Yes.
491,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Will it take three years?
492,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,No.
493,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Benjen Stark,Welcome.
494,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
495,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Maester Luwin,The boy was always sure-footed before.
496,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
497,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Theon Greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?"
498,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
499,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Rodrick Cassel,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
500,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
501,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Theon Greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
502,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Maester Luwin,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
503,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
504,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,I'll ride to King's Landing.
505,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
506,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,"Mother, you can't."
507,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I must.
508,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Rodrick Cassel,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
509,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
510,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Rodrick Cassel,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
511,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robb Stark,What about Bran?
512,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Catelyn Stark,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
513,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,"No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
514,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,Finish a man?
515,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
516,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
517,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
518,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
519,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Doreah,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
520,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Daenerys Targaryen,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
521,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"Pardon me, Ser."
522,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sandor Clegane,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
523,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
524,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sandor Clegane,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
525,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
526,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
527,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
528,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Mycah,I'll get you!
529,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,Arya!
530,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,What are you doing here? Go away.
531,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
532,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Mycah,"Mycah, my Lord."
533,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,He the butcher's boy.
534,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,He's my friend.
535,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
536,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Mycah,"She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
537,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
538,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Mycah,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
539,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
540,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Stop it!
541,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"Arya, stay out of this."
542,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
543,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
544,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
545,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Nymeria!
546,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,Please don't.
547,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
548,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,Then go! Don't touch me.
549,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Soldier,The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
550,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
551,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Soldier,It's a direwolf.
552,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Soldier,I'll check down here.
553,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Soldier,I think I heard a noise.
554,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Go!
555,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jory Cassel,My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
556,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Where is she?
557,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jory Cassel,She's been taken directly before the King.
558,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Who took her?
559,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jory Cassel,The Lannisters found her.
560,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"Right, get back."
561,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Jory Cassel,The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
562,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Back! Back to the inn. All back!
563,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,I'm sorry.
564,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Are you hurt?
565,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,No.
566,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
567,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
568,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
569,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
570,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
571,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
572,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,That's not what happened!
573,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
574,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Liar!
575,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Joffrey Lannister,Shut up!
576,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
577,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,In bed asleep.
578,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
579,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
580,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
581,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Liar! Liar liar liar!
582,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Stop it! That's enough of that.
583,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Liar liar liar!
584,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,Stop! Arya!
585,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
586,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
587,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
588,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
589,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"Gladly, your Grace."
590,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
591,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
592,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Soldier,"We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
593,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,So be it.
594,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,We have another wolf.
595,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,As you will.
596,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,You can't mean it.
597,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Robert Baratheon,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
598,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
599,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Arya Stark,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
600,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sansa Stark,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
601,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,s this your command... your Grace?
602,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Where is the beast?
603,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Soldier,"Chained up outside, your Grace."
604,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
605,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,"No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
606,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Cersei Lannister,Is this some trick?
607,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
608,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Eddard Stark,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
609,2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,Sandor Clegane,He ran... Not very fast.
610,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Kings Landing Guard,"Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."
611,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
612,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jory Cassel,"Yes, my Lord."
613,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Kings Landing Guard,If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
614,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
615,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
616,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
617,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
618,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
619,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
620,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
621,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,But you just stood there and watched.
622,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
623,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
624,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
625,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"You served him well, when serving was safe."
626,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,Lord Stark.
627,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Lord Varys.
628,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
629,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
630,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Renly Baratheon,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
631,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
632,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
633,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
634,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
635,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
636,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grand Maester Pycelle,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
637,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Grand Maester.
638,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grand Maester Pycelle,How many years has it been? You were a young man.
639,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,And you served another King.
640,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grand Maester Pycelle,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
641,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Without the King?
642,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Renly Baratheon,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
643,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
644,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.
645,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Renly Baratheon,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
646,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"Mmm, how much?"
647,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
648,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grand Maester Pycelle,Can the treasury bear such expense?
649,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
650,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
651,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
652,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,How could you let this happen?
653,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
654,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
655,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grand Maester Pycelle,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
656,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Renly Baratheon,"Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
657,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
658,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
659,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
660,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
661,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed."
662,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,It's ugly.
663,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
664,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
665,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
666,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,Do I have to marry her?
667,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
668,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,I don't want to.
669,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
670,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
671,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,How would you handle them?
672,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
673,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,A royal army?
674,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
675,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,And if the northerners rebel?
676,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
677,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
678,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,For me. I'm their King.
679,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
680,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,I'm not asking.
681,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
682,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Joffrey Lannister,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
683,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
684,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Septa Mordane,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
685,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,I'm practicing.
686,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Sansa Stark,Practicing for what?
687,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,The Prince.
688,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Septa Mordane,"Arya, stop!"
689,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
690,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Sansa Stark,The Hound killed your friend.
691,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
692,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Sansa Stark,You're an idiot.
693,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
694,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Septa Mordane,Enough!
695,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,What's happening here?
696,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Septa Mordane,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
697,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
698,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
699,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Sansa Stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
700,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Septa Mordane,You've barely eaten a thing.
701,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,It's all right. Go on.
702,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,War was easier than daughters.
703,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,Go away!
704,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
705,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,Mine.
706,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
707,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
708,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
709,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,It's called Needle.
710,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
711,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
712,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,laughs] That's the essence of it.
713,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
714,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
715,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
716,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
717,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,So was I! He is a liar.
718,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
719,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
720,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
721,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,Winter is coming.
722,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
723,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,I don't hate her. Not really.
724,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
725,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,I can keep it?
726,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
727,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Old Nan,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
728,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Bran Stark,I hate your stories.
729,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Old Nan,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
730,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Bran Stark,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
731,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Old Nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
732,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robb Stark,What are you telling him now?
733,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Old Nan,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
734,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robb Stark,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
735,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Bran Stark,Maybe we do.
736,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robb Stark,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
737,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Bran Stark,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
738,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robb Stark,Don't ever say that.
739,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Bran Stark,I'd rather be dead.
740,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rodrick Cassel,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
741,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
742,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rodrick Cassel,My Lady.
743,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Guard,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
744,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
745,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Guard,We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
746,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
747,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Guard,"Follow me, Lady Stark."
748,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
749,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
750,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
751,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
752,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
753,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
754,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,A dear friend told me.
755,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,Lady Stark.
756,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Lord Varys.
757,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
758,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,How did you know I was coming?
759,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
760,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Do you know whose dagger this is?
761,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Varys,I must admit I do not.
762,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
763,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Yours?
764,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
765,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,To whom?
766,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
767,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Alliser Thorne,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
768,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Alliser Thorne,Next!
769,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Alliser Thorne,"Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
770,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,A charming man.
771,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jeor Mormont,I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
772,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
773,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jeor Mormont,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
774,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,Good news or bad?
775,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jeor Mormont,Both.
776,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grand Maester Pycelle,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
777,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
778,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,My wife is in Winterfell.
779,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,Is she?
780,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
781,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,You're a funny man. A very funny man.
782,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
783,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
784,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grenn,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
785,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,It's an improvement.
786,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grenn,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
787,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Pyp,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
788,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grenn,"What're you looking at, halfman?"
789,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
790,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rast,What do you care about our faces?
791,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
792,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Grenn,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
793,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
794,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
795,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
796,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
797,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
798,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,We have proof. We have the blade.
799,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
800,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
801,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
802,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
803,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Petyr Baelish,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
804,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,How could you be so stupid?
805,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,Calm down.
806,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
807,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
808,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
809,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,Then what are you raving about?
810,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
811,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
812,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,And my husband?
813,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
814,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,Let me go.
815,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,Never.
816,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
817,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,I wish I could see the girls.
818,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,It's too dangerous.
819,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Just for a moment.
820,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Until we know who our enemies are...
821,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
822,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
823,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Cersei Lannister,And if you find the proof?
824,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
825,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
826,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,He still loves you.
827,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Catelyn Stark,Does he?
828,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Eddard Stark,Off with you.
829,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
830,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Barristan Selmy,"Of course, your Grace."
831,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,Who was it?
832,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Barristan Selmy,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
833,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,How'd you do it?
834,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Barristan Selmy,Lance through the heart.
835,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
836,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Lancel Lannister,"It's empty, your Grace."
837,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,What do you mean it's empty?
838,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Lancel Lannister,There's no more wine.
839,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
840,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
841,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Barristan Selmy,"I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
842,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
843,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Barristan Selmy,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
844,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,Your outlaw... Any last words?
845,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"I cut his head off, so no."
846,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Robert Baratheon,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
847,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jaime Lannister,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
848,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
849,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,From whom?
850,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
851,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,Tell them all to stop.
852,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
853,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,Until I command them otherwise.
854,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,You're learning to talk like a Queen.
855,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
856,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Viserys Targaryen,You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
857,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
858,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,No!
859,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
860,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
861,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Viserys Targaryen,Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
862,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
863,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,You walk. [to Viserys]
864,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
865,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,You're leaving?
866,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
867,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,What kind of reports?
868,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,The kind I don't want to believe.
869,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,m ready. I won't let you down.
870,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
871,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,But I'm better than every...
872,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
873,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,A bear's balls.
874,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,You're joking?
875,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
876,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,And how do a bear's balls taste?
877,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
878,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
879,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
880,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
881,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
882,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
883,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
884,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
885,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,Call me what you like.
886,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
887,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
888,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
889,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
890,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
891,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Benjen Stark,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
892,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,I always do.
893,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
894,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
895,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
896,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
897,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
898,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Yoren,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
899,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
900,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
901,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,What are you doing?
902,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
903,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
904,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
905,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,Armor.
906,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
907,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,Slow.
908,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,Slow.
909,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
910,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
911,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
912,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
913,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
914,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
915,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,There are no rabbits.
916,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
917,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
918,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
919,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
920,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
921,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rakharo,A blessing from the Great Stallion.
922,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Irri,She does not want to eat horse.
923,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
924,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Rhakaro,We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
925,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jorah Mormont,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
926,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
927,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Maester Aemon,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
928,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"Eight... no, nine."
929,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Maester Aemon,All of them brief?
930,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
931,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Maester Aemon,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
932,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jeor Mormont,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
933,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
934,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jeor Mormont,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
935,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Maester Aemon,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
936,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jeor Mormont,Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
937,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Maester Aemon,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
938,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,It's a boy.
939,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Khal Drogo,How do you know?
940,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Daenerys Targaryen,I know.
941,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
942,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
943,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
944,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
945,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
946,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,Of course.
947,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,He'll never walk again.
948,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Tyrion Lannister,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
949,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Jon Snow,"Farewell, My Lord."
950,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
951,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,Who are you?
952,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
953,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
954,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,It's too heavy.
955,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
956,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,What if I drop it?
957,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
958,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,I'm a girl.
959,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
960,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Arya Stark,A needle.
961,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
962,2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,Syrio Forel,"Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
963,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Old Nan,The little Lordo s been dreaming again.
964,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,We have visitors.
965,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bran Stark,I don't want to see anyone.
966,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
967,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bran Stark,I don't want to go.
968,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
969,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
970,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robb Stark,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
971,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
972,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robb Stark,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
973,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
974,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
975,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Maester Luwin,He has no memory of that day.
976,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,Curious.
977,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robb Stark,Why are you here?
978,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
979,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bran Stark,"Kneel, Hodor."
980,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
981,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bran Stark,"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
982,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Maester Luwin,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
983,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
984,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bran Stark,I'm not a cripple.
985,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
986,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bran Stark,Will I really be able to ride?
987,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
988,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robb Stark,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
989,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
990,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robb Stark,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
991,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
992,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
993,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
994,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,He's not my master.
995,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
996,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,She wasn't feeling well.
997,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
998,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,My lady's whereabouts...
999,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1000,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,Must have been a pretty sight.
1001,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1002,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
1003,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1004,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Theon Greyjoy,"Careful, Imp."
1005,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1006,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1007,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,What in seven hells is that?
1008,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Pyp,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
1009,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,Tell them your name.
1010,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
1011,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Rast,Come to take the black pudding.
1012,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
1013,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"I yield. Please, no more."
1014,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
1015,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Enough! He yielded.
1016,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
1017,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Are you sure you want to do this?
1018,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
1019,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
1020,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Pyp,Well fought!
1021,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,Piss off.
1022,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Did he hurt you?
1023,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,I've had worse.
1024,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
1025,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
1026,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,Why didn't you get up and fight?
1027,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
1028,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,Why not?
1029,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,I'm a coward. My father always says so.
1030,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,The Wall's no place for cowards.
1031,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
1032,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
1033,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Pyp,You're too stupid to be a coward.
1034,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,You're too stupid to be a...
1035,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Pyp,"Quick now, before summer's over."
1036,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,Come on here!
1037,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
1038,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
1039,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
1040,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
1041,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
1042,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
1043,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,But if they did?
1044,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
1045,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,And you know these men?
1046,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
1047,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,You sold slaves.
1048,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,Aye.
1049,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,Why?
1050,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,I had no money and an expensive wife.
1051,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,And where is she now?
1052,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,"In another place, with another man."
1053,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,Your Grace?
1054,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"Yes, my dear?"
1055,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,They call you the last dragon...
1056,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,They do.
1057,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
1058,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,It's entirely possible.
1059,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1060,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1061,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
1062,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,Really? Why dragons?
1063,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
1064,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
1065,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
1066,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,What have you seen?
1067,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1068,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,A pirate ship?
1069,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,A dragon.
1070,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
1071,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,What happened to the skulls?
1072,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
1073,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,That's very sad.
1074,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
1075,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,"No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
1076,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
1077,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
1078,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,What if I have a girl?
1079,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,"Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
1080,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,What if I only have girls?
1081,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,I wouldn't worry about that.
1082,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
1083,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
1084,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,But what if?
1085,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
1086,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,And everyone would hate me.
1087,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,Nobody could ever hate you.
1088,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,Joffrey does.
1089,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
1090,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,Please shut up about it.
1091,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
1092,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,Aegon the Conqueror.
1093,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,And who built the Red Keep?
1094,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,Maegor the Cruel.
1095,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,And how many years did it take to build...
1096,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
1097,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
1098,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,The Mad King.
1099,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,Commonly known as the Mad King.
1100,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,Why were they killed?
1101,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,You should speak to your father about these matters.
1102,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
1103,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
1104,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,"No, I won't."
1105,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Janos Slynt,"It's the Hando s tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
1106,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
1107,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Janos Slynt,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
1108,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Varys,Dreadful.
1109,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Renly Baratheon,"If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1110,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Janos Slynt,I need more men.
1111,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
1112,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,I will?
1113,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
1114,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Janos Slynt,"Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use."
1115,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"The sooner this is over, the better."
1116,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Varys,"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
1117,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
1118,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"
1119,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
1120,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
1121,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
1122,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Why?
1123,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
1124,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,What did Jon want the night before he died?
1125,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,He came inquiring after a book.
1126,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,A book? What book?
1127,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
1128,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,I'd like to read it.
1129,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."
1130,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
1131,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
1132,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
1133,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
1134,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Jon's death...
1135,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,Such a tragedy.
1136,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
1137,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
1138,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
1139,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
1140,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
1141,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,What else could it be?
1142,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Poison.
1143,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1144,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1145,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
1146,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Everybody knows that.
1147,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
1148,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,I've taken enough of your time.
1149,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grand Maester Pycelle,"No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
1150,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
1151,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
1152,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,It's a hard fall down these steps.
1153,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
1154,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Cats? Syrio says…
1155,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
1156,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,He's right about that.
1157,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
1158,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,He needs to get his strength back first.
1159,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,"He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
1160,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1161,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
1162,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
1163,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,No. That's not me.
1164,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
1165,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
1166,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"No, that's all right. I'm fine."
1167,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,You're not. You're freezing.
1168,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,I don't like high places.
1169,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
1170,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
1171,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"Yes, he is."
1172,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"I'm not going to get any better, you know?"
1173,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Well… You can't get any worse.
1174,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,I hear you're reading a boring book.
1175,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Pycelle talks too much.
1176,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
1177,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
1178,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
1179,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
1180,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
1181,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Varys or the Queen?
1182,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
1183,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Yes.
1184,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
1185,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
1186,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
1187,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
1188,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
1189,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Hugh Of Vale,"As you can see, I'm busy."
1190,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
1191,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Hugh Of Vale,"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
1192,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
1193,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Hugh Of Vale,"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
1194,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
1195,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
1196,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
1197,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Let them look.
1198,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tobho Mott,"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
1199,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,What did Lord Arryn want?
1200,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tobho Mott,He always came to see the boy.
1201,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,I'd like to see him as well.
1202,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tobho Mott,"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
1203,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,This is fine work.
1204,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Gendry Baratheon,It's not for sale.
1205,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tobho Mott,"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
1206,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Gendry Baratheon,I made it for me.
1207,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tobho Mott,"Forgive him, my Lord."
1208,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
1209,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Gendry Baratheon,"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
1210,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,What kind of questions?
1211,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Gendry Baratheon,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
1212,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Your mother?
1213,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Gendry Baratheon,"Who she was, what she looked like."
1214,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,What did you tell him?
1215,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Gendry Baratheon,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
1216,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
1217,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,Find anything?
1218,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,King Robert's bastard son.
1219,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,This is for the King from Lord Stark.
1220,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
1221,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,Three? Four?
1222,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
1223,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"Forgive me, my Lord..."
1224,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
1225,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"We've met before, you know."
1226,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
1227,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
1228,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,That's where you got your scar?
1229,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
1230,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,Vicious sons of whores.
1231,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,They like their bloodshed.
1232,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1233,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1234,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
1235,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,Theon? He's a good lad.
1236,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,I doubt it.
1237,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robert Baratheon,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
1238,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
1239,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jaime Lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.
1240,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,Where have you been?
1241,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Watch duty. With Sam.
1242,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Pyp,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
1243,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,He wasn't hungry.
1244,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Pyp,Impossible!
1245,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
1246,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Rast,"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
1247,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,No one touches Sam.
1248,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
1249,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Grenn,"Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
1250,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
1251,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
1252,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Doreah,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
1253,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
1254,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
1255,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,Why did you hit her?!
1256,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
1257,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1258,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,What's this?
1259,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
1260,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1261,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,Please.
1262,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,This stinks of manure. All of it.
1263,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,Stop - stop it.
1264,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
1265,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
1266,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,You do not talk back to me!
1267,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Viserys Targaryen,You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1268,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1269,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1270,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,I wouldn't doubt it.
1271,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1272,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Sally on the side?
1273,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1274,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1275,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1276,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1277,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,I find that hard to believe.
1278,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1279,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,You didn't know where to put it?
1280,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,I know where to put it.
1281,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?
1282,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1283,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,What color hair?
1284,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Red.
1285,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,I like red hair. And her... Her...
1286,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,You don't want to know.
1287,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,That good?
1288,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,Better.
1289,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1290,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,What's my name?
1291,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Jon Snow?
1292,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,And why is my surname Snow?
1293,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1294,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1295,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,So... You didn't know where to put it?
1296,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1297,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sam Tarly,It is a bit nippy.
1298,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1299,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jon Snow,I build my own fires.
1300,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Alliser Thorne,"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
1301,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1302,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1303,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,He is still the true King.
1304,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,The truth now
1305,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1306,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
1307,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1308,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jorah Mormont,Home.
1309,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Daenerys Targaryen,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
1310,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,Lover's quarrel?
1311,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,I'm sorry. Do I...?
1312,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
1313,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
1314,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Arya Stark,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
1315,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,Arya!
1316,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Septa Mordane,Don't be rude!
1317,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
1318,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robert Baratheon,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
1319,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,"Gods, who is that?"
1320,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
1321,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,And his opponent?
1322,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
1323,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Robert Baratheon,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
1324,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1325,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Sansa Stark,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
1326,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Petyr Baelish,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
1327,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Jory Cassel,"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
1328,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Your Grace.
1329,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,You're missing your tournament.
1330,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
1331,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
1332,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,She likes it here.
1333,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
1334,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,What are you doing here?
1335,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
1336,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
1337,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
1338,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"If that's my job, then so be it."
1339,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
1340,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Eddard Stark,"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
1341,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Cersei Lannister,As was I.
1342,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Marillion,"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
1343,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Catelyn Stark,And to you.
1344,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Rodrick Cassel,"Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
1345,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Marillion,"Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
1346,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Rodrick Cassel,I'd rather throw myself down a well.
1347,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Marillion,"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
1348,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Masha Heddle,"I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
1349,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
1350,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Masha Heddle,"Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
1351,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
1352,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Bronn,You can have my room.
1353,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
1354,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Yoren,"Aye, my Lord."
1355,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Marillion,My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
1356,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
1357,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Masha Heddle,Lady Stark.
1358,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Catelyn Stark,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
1359,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Knight Of House Whent,"It is, my Lady."
1360,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Catelyn Stark,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
1361,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Knight Of House Whent,She is.
1362,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Catelyn Stark,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
1363,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Knight Of House Bracken,Our lord is honored by his trust.
1364,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Tyrion Lannister,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
1365,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Catelyn Stark,Knight of House Frey
1366,2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",Catelyn Stark,"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
1367,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
1368,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1369,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,He'd never worn this armor before.
1370,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1371,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Who determines the draw?
1372,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
1373,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
1374,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
1375,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
1376,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
1377,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
1378,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,"He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
1379,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1380,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
1381,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Yes. That will never happen.
1382,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Barristan Selmy,Robert tends to do what he wants.
1383,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
1384,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lancel Lannister,"It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
1385,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
1386,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You're too fat for your armor.
1387,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
1388,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Oh, it's funny, is it?"
1389,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lancel Lannister,"No, Your Grace."
1390,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,No? You don't like the Hando s joke?
1391,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You're torturing the poor boy.
1392,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
1393,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,The breastplate stretcher?
1394,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,How long before he figures it out?
1395,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Maybe you should have one invented.
1396,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
1397,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
1398,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
1399,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,And who's going to hit you back?
1400,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
1401,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
1402,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
1403,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Aye.
1404,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Drink.
1405,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I'm not thirsty.
1406,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
1407,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Your squire... A Lannister boy?
1408,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
1409,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Robert?
1410,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
1411,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Where's Arya
1412,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sansa Stark,At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
1413,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sansa Stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
1414,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sansa Stark,Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
1415,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Hey.
1416,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sansa Stark,I can't watch.
1417,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
1418,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,I'll take that bet.
1419,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
1420,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Or you could even buy a friend.
1421,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sansa Stark,He's going to die.
1422,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Ser Loras rides well.
1423,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
1424,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
1425,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
1426,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sansa Stark,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
1427,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
1428,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
1429,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,"I owe you my life, Ser."
1430,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Sandor Clegane,I'm no Ser.
1431,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,Remove his hood.
1432,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Marillion,"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold."
1433,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
1434,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,I did... often and loudly.
1435,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
1436,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,And why would I do that?
1437,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
1438,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
1439,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
1440,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,Five years ago.
1441,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
1442,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,"I am not a murderer, Lannister."
1443,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
1444,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,The dagger found
1445,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
1446,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Rodrik Cassel,Should I gag him?
1447,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
1448,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Rodrik Cassel,"My Lady, this way."
1449,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
1450,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,Rodrik?
1451,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Rodrik Cassel,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
1452,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bronn,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
1453,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
1454,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Bran...
1455,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - ""We do not sow""."
1456,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Lords?
1457,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,The Greyjoys.
1458,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
1459,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,And failed rebellions.
1460,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
1461,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Good.
1462,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"Words - ""Ours is the fury"". Lords - the Baratheons."
1463,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
1464,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Hmm...
1465,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"Words - ""A Lannister always pays his debts."""
1466,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,"No. A common saying, but not their official motto."
1467,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Lords - the Lannisters.
1468,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,We're still on their words.
1469,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,I don't know them.
1470,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,You do know them. Think.
1471,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
1472,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,That's House Martell.
1473,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"Righteous in wrath""."
1474,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,House Hornwood.
1475,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"Family, duty, honor""."
1476,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
1477,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
1478,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,You know it is.
1479,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Family comes first?
1480,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
1481,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
1482,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
1483,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,And then she left!
1484,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
1485,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Why did she leave?
1486,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,"I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
1487,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Do you know where she is now? Today?
1488,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,"No, I don't."
1489,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
1490,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
1491,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,I'll never shoot another arrow.
1492,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,And where is that written?
1493,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,You need legs to work a bow.
1494,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,"Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
1495,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bran Stark,Really?
1496,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Maester Luwin,Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
1497,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
1498,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
1499,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Important enough for the likes of you.
1500,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,"You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
1501,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
1502,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,Jealous?
1503,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Why should I be jealous?
1504,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
1505,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,Might surprise you.
1506,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Hmm?
1507,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
1508,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
1509,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,You are jealous.
1510,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
1511,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,And what about the Starks?
1512,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
1513,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,"A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
1514,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
1515,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,You're a very serious boy.
1516,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,I'm not a boy.
1517,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,"Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
1518,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Theon Greyjoy,I don't want to pay for it.
1519,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Ros,Then get yourself a wife.
1520,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1521,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"How is your son, my Lord?"
1522,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,He'll never walk again.
1523,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,But his mind is sound?
1524,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,So they say.
1525,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
1526,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
1527,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
1528,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,I didn't trust you.
1529,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,So why do you trust me now?
1530,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
1531,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,What sort of doom does the King face?
1532,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
1533,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Who gave it to him?
1534,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
1535,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
1536,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
1537,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
1538,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Someone who could afford it.
1539,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
1540,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,He started asking questions.
1541,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
1542,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Illyrio Mopatis,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
1543,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
1544,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Illyrio Mopatis,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
1545,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,This Hand is not the other.
1546,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Illyrio Mopatis,We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
1547,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
1548,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Illyrio Mopatis,It never was.
1549,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
1550,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,You do move quietly.
1551,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,We all have our qualities.
1552,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
1553,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
1554,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
1555,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
1556,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
1557,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
1558,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
1559,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
1560,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
1561,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Strictly speaking.
1562,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
1563,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
1564,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
1565,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
1566,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,Saw me with your own eyes?
1567,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Eyes I own.
1568,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
1569,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
1570,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,One shudders at the thought.
1571,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Oh.
1572,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
1573,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Have you?
1574,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
1575,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Was that you under the bed?
1576,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
1577,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"Oh, please."
1578,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
1579,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
1580,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,To a small council meeting?
1581,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
1582,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Guard,Off with you. No begging.
1583,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
1584,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Guard,D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
1585,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,I want to see my father.
1586,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Guard,"I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
1587,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Guard,"You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
1588,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
1589,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
1590,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,They said they were going to kill you.
1591,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Who did?
1592,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
1593,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"Oh, Arya."
1594,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
1595,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Where did you hear this?
1596,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
1597,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,What were you doing in the dungeons?
1598,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,Chasing a cat.
1599,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,"Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
1600,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"Your name, friend?"
1601,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Yoren,"Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
1602,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,I'm a girl!
1603,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Did Benjen send you?
1604,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Yoren,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
1605,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
1606,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Yoren,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
1607,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Know what?
1608,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Yoren,"Best said in private, my Lord."
1609,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Go on. We'll talk more later.
1610,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
1611,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,"Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
1612,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,How many guards does my father have?
1613,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
1614,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Arya Stark,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
1615,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,"No fear on that count, little Lady."
1616,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Well?
1617,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Yoren,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
1618,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Vardis Egen,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
1619,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,To whom do I speak?
1620,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Vardis Egen,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
1621,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,There was no time to send word.
1622,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Vardis Egen,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
1623,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
1624,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Vardis Egen,He doesn't look like a prisoner.
1625,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,My sister will decide what he looks like.
1626,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Vardis Egen,"Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
1627,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
1628,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Bronn,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
1629,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,I like you.
1630,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Steward,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
1631,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I need to see the King first -- alone.
1632,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Steward,"The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
1633,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Is it about my wife?
1634,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Steward,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
1635,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,The whore is pregnant.
1636,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You're speaking of murdering a child.
1637,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
1638,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
1639,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
1640,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Then we're no better than the Mad King.
1641,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
1642,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
1643,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
1644,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Based on whose information?
1645,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
1646,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
1647,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
1648,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
1649,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
1650,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
1651,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
1652,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Varys,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
1653,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Grand Maester Pycelle,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
1654,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,We should have had them both killed years ago.
1655,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
1656,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
1657,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,She dies.
1658,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I will have no part in it.
1659,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
1660,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
1661,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
1662,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
1663,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,"Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
1664,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
1665,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,What can I do for you?
1666,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,When do you return to Winterfell?
1667,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Why? What do you care?
1668,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
1669,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I don't have the time.
1670,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
1671,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
1672,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,Heward and Wyl.
1673,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Find them and meet me at the stables.
1674,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
1675,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
1676,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
1677,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robin Arryn,Mommy? Is that the bad man?
1678,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,It is.
1679,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robin Arryn,He's little.
1680,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
1681,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
1682,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
1683,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Tyrion Lannister,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
1684,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robin Arryn,"You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
1685,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,"Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
1686,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robin Arryn,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
1687,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,"Perhaps you will, my little love."
1688,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Catelyn Stark,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
1689,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Lysa Arryn,"Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
1690,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Mord,"You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
1691,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
1692,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
1693,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,You're jealous.
1694,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Are you sure this won't hurt?
1695,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Only if I slip.
1696,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,And you prefer me like this?
1697,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Mhmm.
1698,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
1699,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,I want you.
1700,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
1701,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Hold still.
1702,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
1703,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
1704,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
1705,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
1706,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
1707,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
1708,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
1709,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
1710,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Everywhere?
1711,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
1712,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
1713,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
1714,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
1715,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,I have an outrageous amount of money.
1716,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Not as much as the Lannisters.
1717,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,But a lot more than you.
1718,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
1719,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Hmm... How did that ever happen?
1720,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
1721,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Do you know who should be King?
1722,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Be serious.
1723,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,"I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
1724,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,I'm fourth in line.
1725,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
1726,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,Stannis?
1727,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
1728,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,He's still my older brother.
1729,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,What are you doing?!
1730,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,Look at it.
1731,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Renly Baratheon,You cut me!
1732,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,"It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
1733,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loras Tyrell,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
1734,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
1735,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
1736,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
1737,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
1738,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
1739,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
1740,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
1741,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
1742,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,Is my father wrong?
1743,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
1744,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,We still outnumber them.
1745,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
1746,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,Five.
1747,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
1748,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,What do you want?
1749,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
1750,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,Our marriage.
1751,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
1752,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,Every day.
1753,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,How long can hate hold a thing together?
1754,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
1755,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"Yes, it is."
1756,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
1757,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
1758,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
1759,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,So why now?
1760,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
1761,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
1762,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
1763,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,I know.
1764,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
1765,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Robert Baratheon,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
1766,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Cersei Lannister,It doesn't make me feel anything.
1767,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Mhaegen,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
1768,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Mhaegen,"Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
1769,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I will.
1770,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Mhaegen,"And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
1771,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
1772,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Mhaegen,"He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
1773,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
1774,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
1775,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
1776,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
1777,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,How many?
1778,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
1779,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
1780,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
1781,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Come.
1782,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,Jory!
1783,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,My Lord.
1784,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,Such a small pack of wolves.
1785,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,"Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
1786,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
1787,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
1788,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
1789,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,I remember him well.
1790,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
1791,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
1792,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Petyr Baelish,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
1793,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
1794,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jory Cassel,If you threaten my Lord again...
1795,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
1796,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Eddard Stark,"You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
1797,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
1798,2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,Jaime Lannister,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
1799,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"Your pardon, your Grace."
1800,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,Do you know what your wife has done?
1801,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,She did nothing I did not command.
1802,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,Who'd have thought she had it in her?
1803,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
1804,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,I am the King's Hand -
1805,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,You were the King's Hand!
1806,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,trying to keep the peace -
1807,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,You shall now be held accountable.
1808,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime."
1809,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,He butchered my men.
1810,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
1811,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Quiet, woman."
1812,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
1813,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,I took you for a king.
1814,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,Hold your tongue.
1815,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
1816,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Cersei Lannister,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
1817,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
1818,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
1819,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,If we don't act… there will be a war.
1820,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
1821,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
1822,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!"
1823,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight."
1824,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt."
1825,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,The hunt?
1826,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
1827,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,The Targaryen girl -
1828,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."
1829,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Irri,Khaleesi?
1830,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Irri,"Oh, Khaleesi!"
1831,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,You're hurt.
1832,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Not too fast.
1833,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,"Come on, Dancer."
1834,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,When are you gonna tell him?
1835,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Not now.
1836,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
1837,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,You're talking about war.
1838,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,I'm talking about justice.
1839,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
1840,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
1841,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
1842,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
1843,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,"And it's not your duty, because it's not your House."
1844,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Where's Bran?
1845,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,I don't know. It's not my House.
1846,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,Robb?
1847,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Osha,All alone in the deep dark woods.
1848,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,"I'm not alone, my brother is with me."
1849,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
1850,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Osha,"Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver."
1851,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
1852,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,"I can't. The saddle, the straps."
1853,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
1854,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,"I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
1855,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
1856,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Osha,the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
1857,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
1858,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
1859,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,Robb!
1860,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,Shut up! Drop the blade!
1861,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,"No, don't."
1862,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Wildling,Do it.
1863,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Are you all right?
1864,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bran Stark,"Yes, it doesn't hurt."
1865,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
1866,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
1867,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
1868,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,You don't have the right -
1869,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
1870,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,What about her?
1871,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Osha,"Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."
1872,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robb Stark,We'll keep her alive.
1873,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
1874,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,Dwarf man making noise!
1875,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,How would you like to be rich?
1876,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,Dwarf man still making noise.
1877,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold."
1878,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,No gold!
1879,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, I don't have it here."
1880,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,No gold! Fuck off.
1881,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,I don't want to practice today.
1882,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,No?
1883,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
1884,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,You are troubled.
1885,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,Yes -
1886,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,"Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
1887,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,I don't like dolls and k -
1888,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…
1889,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,"More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
1890,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,The old and the new.
1891,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Syrio Forel,There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”
1892,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
1893,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,She's doing well.
1894,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,She'll never keep it down.
1895,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Tell me what she is saying.
1896,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
1897,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,She's going to have a boy.
1898,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.
1899,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,"The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."
1900,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
1901,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,They love her.
1902,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,She truly is a queen today.
1903,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
1904,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,It's not my law.
1905,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,They don't belong to you.
1906,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Whatever is hers is also mine.
1907,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,"Once, perhaps."
1908,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,"If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army."
1909,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,And you have all three.
1910,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,"I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
1911,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,"You can go, but you can't have the eggs."
1912,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
1913,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,It means everything to me.
1914,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,And yet here you stand?
1915,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,And here I stand.
1916,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
1917,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,Noise again!
1918,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,About the gold -
1919,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
1920,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,Where?
1921,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
1922,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,You want free? Go be free.
1923,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
1924,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mord,What message?
1925,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
1926,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,You wish to confess your crimes?
1927,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
1928,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,"Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
1929,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
1930,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,Silence!
1931,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robin Arryn,What happened next?!
1932,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,What do you think you're doing?
1933,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Confessing my crimes.
1934,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Catelyn Stark,"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
1935,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
1936,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,"You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
1937,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
1938,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,"If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
1939,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,I understand the law.
1940,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
1941,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,"You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
1942,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
1943,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,You have that right.
1944,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Knight,"My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
1945,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Knight,The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
1946,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Knight,"I'll fight for you, my Lady."
1947,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Knight,It'll be my honor.
1948,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Knight,The honor should be mine.
1949,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robin Arryn,Make the bad man fly!
1950,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
1951,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ser Vardis,"With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
1952,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Agreed.
1953,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,You demanded a trial by combat.
1954,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
1955,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ser Vardis,"My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you."
1956,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
1957,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
1958,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,"Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
1959,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,The trial will be today.
1960,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Do I have a volunteer?
1961,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Anyone?... Anyone?
1962,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
1963,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bronn,I'll stand for the dwarf.
1964,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lancel Lannister,"More wine, your Grace?"
1965,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Oh, what was I saying?"
1966,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Renly Baratheon,A simpler time.
1967,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?"
1968,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Barriston,"It was, your Grace."
1969,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
1970,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Renly Baratheon,Sounds exhilarating.
1971,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
1972,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Renly Baratheon,"Once, I think."
1973,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
1974,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Renly Baratheon,Those were some lucky girls.
1975,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
1976,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Barristan Selmy,"I don't believe so, your Grace."
1977,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,Those were the days!
1978,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Renly Baratheon,"What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
1979,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robert Baratheon,"Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
1980,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Renly Baratheon,I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
1981,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Man,"They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
1982,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,"Brigands, most likely."
1983,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Man,"They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."
1984,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,"It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting."
1985,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Petyr Baelish,Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
1986,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
1987,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Man,"None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
1988,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Petyr Baelish,That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
1989,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
1990,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
1991,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Petyr Baelish,I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
1992,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,"If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -"
1993,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Petyr Baelish,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
1994,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,Wel…
1995,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
1996,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
1997,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Beric Dondarrion,As you command.
1998,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
1999,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
2000,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,Grand Maester Pycelle.
2001,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Grand Maester Pycelle,My Lord.
2002,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2003,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Petyr Baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2004,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2005,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robin Arryn,Is it over?
2006,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Lysa Arryn,You don't fight with honor!
2007,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Bronn,No. He did.
2008,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Robin Arryn,Can I make the little man fly now?
2009,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2010,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Tyrion Lannister,A Lannister always pays his debts.
2011,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2012,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,"Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south."
2013,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2014,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,My mother isn't from the North.
2015,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,I'm aware of that.
2016,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2017,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,Yes. I have hair.
2018,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,I've never seen it.
2019,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,Would you like to?
2020,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,"No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2021,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,I come from a very small village in -
2022,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,"Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care."
2023,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,Sansa -
2024,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,Septa.
2025,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,Now you are being rude.
2026,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Mordane,My prince.
2027,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,My prince.
2028,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Joffrey Lannister,My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2029,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2030,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Joffrey Lannister,"You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2031,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,There's nothing to forgive.
2032,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Joffrey Lannister,"You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2033,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2034,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,Going to King's Landing.
2035,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,In a turnip cart?
2036,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2037,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,And you can afford that?
2038,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,Some of my friends are more generous than others.
2039,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
2040,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,I'll have lots of company…
2041,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
2042,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,"And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
2043,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,Don't be a fool.
2044,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,"I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon."
2045,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,Let me see it one more time?
2046,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,See what?
2047,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Theon Greyjoy,I'm going to miss you!
2048,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Ros,I know.
2049,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
2050,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,What?!
2051,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,Listen -
2052,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,What about Joffrey?
2053,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
2054,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,What? No.
2055,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,"Please, Father. Please don't."
2056,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
2057,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
2058,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,Can't we take Syrio back with us?
2059,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
2060,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,Seven hells.
2061,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -"
2062,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,"I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
2063,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,"The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father."
2064,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
2065,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
2066,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,Wait!
2067,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Arya Stark,Come on!
2068,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Sansa Stark,It's not fair!
2069,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Eddard Stark,"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”"
2070,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Daenerys! Where's my sister?
2071,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,Stop him.
2072,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast.
2073,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,Come.
2074,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
2075,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
2076,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
2077,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,That is no place for a king.
2078,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Khal Drogo,You are no king.
2079,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Keep away from me!
2080,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,"Viserys, please."
2081,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,There she is.
2082,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
2083,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
2084,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
2085,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,What's he saying?
2086,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,"He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
2087,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
2088,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
2089,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,Look away Khaleesi.
2090,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,No.
2091,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,"No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!"
2092,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Viserys Targaryen,Dany please!
2093,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Khal Drogo,A crown for a king.
2094,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Jorah Mormont,Khaleesi…
2095,2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,Daenerys Targaryen,He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
2096,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
2097,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Attacking him was stupid.
2098,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Lannisters don't act like fools.
2099,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,Catelyn Stark took my brother.
2100,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Why is he still alive?
2101,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,Tyrion?
2102,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Ned Stark.
2103,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,"One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
2104,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,It wouldn't have been clean.
2105,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Clean...
2106,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
2107,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
2108,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Now that's what you want people to think of you.
2109,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,It's the truth.
2110,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,"When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"
2111,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,Of course it bothers me.
2112,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2113,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
2114,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,"He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
2115,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaime Lannister,So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
2116,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,"No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
2117,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tywin Lannister,Hmm.
2118,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,You're in pain.
2119,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"I've had worse, my lady."
2120,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,Perhaps it's time to go home.
2121,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
2122,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
2123,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,"Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
2124,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Has he done this before?
2125,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,Jaime would have killed him.
2126,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
2127,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Your brother Or your lover?
2128,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
2129,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
2130,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,My son saw you with him.
2131,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,Do you love your children?
2132,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,With all my heart.
2133,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,No more than I love mine.
2134,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,And they are all Jaime's.
2135,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,Thank the Gods.
2136,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,You've always hated him.
2137,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,Hated him? I worshiped him.
2138,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth."
2139,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
2140,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them."
2141,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,"Oh, but it was."
2142,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,Come here.
2143,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,"No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2144,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,"Yes, My Lord."
2145,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,"Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
2146,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,"Why don't you join us, My Lord?"
2147,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,I'm saving myself for another.
2148,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
2149,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,A stupid saying.
2150,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,She must be very beautiful.
2151,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2152,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,I do believe my lordo s in love.
2153,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,For many years. Most of my life really.
2154,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,Is she still married to him?
2155,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
2156,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Ros,And what do you want?
2157,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,"Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
2158,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
2159,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,Where is it you come from?
2160,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,The Iron Islands.
2161,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,They far away?
2162,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
2163,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,"Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
2164,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,"Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
2165,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,And what's that?
2166,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,Lord.
2167,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,Why?
2168,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2169,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,"What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"
2170,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,I will be lord after my father.
2171,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,So you're not lord now?
2172,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,"No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?"
2173,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
2174,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,I'm not a Southerner.
2175,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2176,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2177,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,"Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2178,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2179,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
2180,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Theon Greyjoy,I thought she was our prisoner.
2181,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2182,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2183,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,I'm used to worse than him.
2184,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2185,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,Why did you come here?
2186,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
2187,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,Why? What are you afraid of?
2188,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2189,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,Owls and Shadowcats and...
2190,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
2191,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Luwin,"The ""things"" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years."
2192,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Osha,"They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping."
2193,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,I miss girls.
2194,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,Why is he alone?
2195,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,"One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for..."
2196,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,There's no rider.
2197,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Night Watch Stable Boy,"Whoa, boy, whoa."
2198,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
2199,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Renly Baratheon,Ned! It's Robert.
2200,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,"I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man."
2201,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,"My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust."
2202,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,"Robert, my sweet..."
2203,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,"Out, all of you!"
2204,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,You damned fool.
2205,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,"Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say."
2206,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,Give it to the council after I'm dead.
2207,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,I will.
2208,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,"And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me."
2209,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory."
2210,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Robert Baratheon,My memory.
2211,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Give him milk of the poppy.
2212,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Barristan Selmy,He was reeling from the wine.
2213,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,No man could have protected him from himself.
2214,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Lord Varys,"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
2215,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Barristan Selmy,"His squire, from the king's own skin."
2216,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,His squire? The Lannister boy?
2217,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Lord Varys,Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
2218,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
2219,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Lord Varys,I'm afraid those birds have flown.
2220,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,"The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs."
2221,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world."
2222,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
2223,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea."
2224,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,Not dirt. Lands.
2225,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"Lands, yes..."
2226,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
2227,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,It's not a chair. It's a...
2228,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen."
2229,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
2230,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,Can't you help me make him understand?
2231,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
2232,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
2233,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
2234,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,And because he had dragons.
2235,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2236,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,You don't believe it.
2237,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report."
2238,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Deanerys Targarian,"Well, I'll come with you."
2239,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,"No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough."
2240,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Little Bird,"Psst, Jorah the Andal."
2241,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!
2242,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine."
2243,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,"My Lady, you are from Westeros."
2244,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Doreah,You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
2245,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,Princess.
2246,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
2247,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,That? Dornish swill.
2248,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"You honor me, Ser."
2249,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,The honor...the honor is all mine.
2250,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Rakharo,"Huh-uh, huh-uh."
2251,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,"You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess."
2252,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,I hope to repay your kindness someday.
2253,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,Rakharo.
2254,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Rakharo,Huh.
2255,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,Is something wrong?
2256,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,I have a thirst. Open it.
2257,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2258,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,Open it.
2259,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,Pour.
2260,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2261,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,Do as he says.
2262,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,As the princess commands.
2263,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,"Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord."
2264,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,You first.
2265,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Wine Merchant,Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
2266,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,You will drink.
2267,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Doreah,Khaleesi! Stop him!
2268,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jorah Mormont,Come.
2269,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jeor Mormont,Here you begin anew.
2270,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,"I do, my lord."
2271,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jeor Mormont,You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
2272,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,"Yes, my lord."
2273,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jeor Mormont,"You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe."
2274,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,"my lord, might I go as well?"
2275,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jeor Mormont,Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
2276,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,"No, my lord."
2277,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,The Night's Watch is my house now.
2278,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jeor Mormont,"As you wish, lad."
2279,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jaremy Rykker,Rangers with me.
2280,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Othell Yarwyck,Builders!
2281,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Aemon,"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library."
2282,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
2283,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Aemon,Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
2284,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,Do you take me for a servant?
2285,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Aemon,We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
2286,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,May I go?
2287,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Maester Aemon,As you wish.
2288,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
2289,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
2290,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Pypar,Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
2291,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2292,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Pypar,You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2293,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2294,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
2295,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Jon Snow,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2296,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Sam Tarly,I always wanted to be a Wizard.
2297,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Renly Baratheon,She won't care.
2298,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2299,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Renly Baratheon,Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
2300,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,What about Stannis?
2301,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Renly Baratheon,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
2302,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Stannis is your older brother.
2303,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Renly Baratheon,This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
2304,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
2305,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Renly Baratheon,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
2306,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tell Me Something,Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
2307,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2308,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
2309,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Tomard,"Yes, My Lord."
2310,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Now leave us.
2311,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,My Lord protector.
2312,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,The King has no true born sons.
2313,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,So when the King dies...
2314,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2315,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,So it would seem. Unless...
2316,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"There is no ""unless""."
2317,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
2318,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Do you have a shred of honor?
2319,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2320,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,We?
2321,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2322,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,What you suggest is treason.
2323,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,Only if we lose.
2324,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.."
2325,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,No. I won't do it.
2326,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,So it will be Stannis and war?
2327,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2328,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2329,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,You promised Catelyn you would help me.
2330,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2331,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2332,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Daenerys Targaryen,He will not have my son.
2333,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2334,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Khal Drogo,"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
2335,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,King Joffrey,Liar!
2336,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2337,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2338,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Cersei Lannister,You think he stands alone?
2339,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,King Joffrey,"Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2340,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
2341,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Janos Slynt,Men of the Watch!
2342,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Eddard Stark,I want no bloodshed.
2343,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,Now!
2344,2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,Petyr Baelish,I did warn you not to trust me.
2345,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"Yah! Left high, left low."
2346,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"Right low, lunge right."
2347,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Steward Of House Stark,"If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is..."
2348,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Septa Mordane,Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
2349,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
2350,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Septa Mordane,Hush! Go back to your room.
2351,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,What is it? What's happening?
2352,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Septa Mordane,Do as I told you. Run!
2353,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"This way! Left, right."
2354,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,"You said right, but you went left."
2355,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,And now you are a dead girl.
2356,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Only 'cause you lied.
2357,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,My tongue lied.
2358,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,"I was so. I watched, but you..."
2359,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
2360,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Meryn Trant,"Arya Stark, come with us."
2361,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
2362,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Meryn Trant,"Mind your place, dancing master."
2363,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,My father wouldn't send you.
2364,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
2365,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Maryn Trant,Take her.
2366,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?"
2367,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Kings Guard,"Get out of my way, little man."
2368,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,I am Syrio Forel.
2369,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Kings Guard,Foreign bastard.
2370,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
2371,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Meryn Trant,Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
2372,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day."
2373,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Meryn Trant,Bloody oafs.
2374,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,"Be gone now, Arya."
2375,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Come with me. Run.
2376,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,The first sword of Braavos does not run.
2377,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,What do we say to the God of death?
2378,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Not today.
2379,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel,Go.
2380,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Not today. Not today.
2381,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,Stay away from me.
2382,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sandor Clegane,Who do you think sent me?
2383,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Needle.
2384,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Stable Boy,There she is.
2385,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,What do you want?
2386,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Stable Boy,"I want you, wolf girl. Come here."
2387,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
2388,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Stable Boy,"She'll reward me, the Queen!"
2389,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Arya Stark,Stay away!
2390,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,"Lord Stark, you must be thirsty."
2391,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,Varys.
2392,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,I promise you it isn't poisoned.
2393,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,What about my daughters?
2394,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
2395,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,And Sansa?
2396,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,Still engaged to Joffrey.
2397,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
2398,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,"And would again, My Lord."
2399,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
2400,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,"Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer."
2401,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
2402,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,The wrong brother sadly.
2403,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,"If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it."
2404,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,"Not today, My Lord."
2405,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Eddard Stark,"Tell me something, Varys."
2406,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,"The Realm, My Lord."
2407,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,"It's Othor, without a doubt."
2408,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Othell Yarwyck,"The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off."
2409,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
2410,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jon Snow,"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
2411,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,Mmm.
2412,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sam Tarly,The smell.
2413,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Othell Yarwyck,What smell?
2414,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sam Tarly,There is none.
2415,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jon Snow,We should burn them.
2416,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Othell Yarwyck,"Snow's not wrong, My Lord."
2417,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
2418,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Othell Yarwyck,You heard him.
2419,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Ser Alliser,"Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing."
2420,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Nights Watch Brother,"Come on, move 'em out."
2421,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself."
2422,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jon Snow,Is there any word of my father?
2423,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,Sit.
2424,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
2425,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jon Snow,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
2426,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jeor Mormont,I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
2427,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,"Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear."
2428,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Grand Maester Pycelle,King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
2429,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
2430,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Cersei Lannister,"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong."
2431,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Grand Maester Pycelle,A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
2432,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,"No, I'm not."
2433,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Petyr Baelish,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
2434,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Cersei Lannister,"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest."
2435,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,Robb.
2436,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Cersei Lannister,"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
2437,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,"If...if I could see my father, talk to him about..."
2438,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Cersei Lannister,"You disappoint me, child."
2439,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,I only meant that...what will happen to him?
2440,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Cersei Lannister,That depends.
2441,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,On...on what?
2442,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Cersei Lannister,On your brother. And on you.
2443,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Robb Stark,Treason? Sansa wrote this?
2444,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Maester Luwin,"It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words."
2445,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Robb Stark,"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?"
2446,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Maester Luwin,"This is a royal command, My Lord."
2447,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Robb Stark,"I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing."
2448,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Robin Arryn,I'm hungry.
2449,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lysa Arryn,"Hush now, darling. You just ate."
2450,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Catelyn Stark,You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
2451,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Robin Arryn,But I'm hungry!
2452,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lysa Arryn,"Soon, love, soon."
2453,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Catelyn Stark,That is what I ask.
2454,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lysa Arryn,"Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after."
2455,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Catelyn Stark,If you fear for the safety of your son...
2456,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lysa Arryn,Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
2457,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Catelyn Stark,And that is why we have to stop them.
2458,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lysa Arryn,"The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord."
2459,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
2460,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Shagga,Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.
2461,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,"And feed it to the goats, yes."
2462,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,Uncle. Father.
2463,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tywin Lannister,The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
2464,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,Sorry to disappoint you.
2465,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tywin Lannister,And who are these Companions of yours?
2466,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tywin Lannister,"This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows."
2467,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Bronn,You wouldn't know him.
2468,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,"May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister."
2469,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tywin Lannister,You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
2470,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,"We have our differences, Jaime and I."
2471,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Jaime Lannister,He's been covering himself in glory.
2472,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Kevan Lannister,"Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland."
2473,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
2474,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tywin Lannister,Is our hostage.
2475,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Tyrion Lannister,How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?

2540,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Lord Varys,A childo s faith Such sweet innocence.
2541,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Grand Maester Pycelle,Treason is treason!

2545,2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,Sansa Stark,He will.
2546,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"You've seen better days, my lord."
2547,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
2548,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
2549,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
2550,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
2551,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
2552,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
2553,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
2554,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
2555,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,"What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"
2556,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2557,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,Robb? He's just a boy.
2558,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2559,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2560,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2561,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2562,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2563,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddard Stark,You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2564,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Varys,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2565,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2566,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Theon Greyjoy,Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
2567,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2568,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2569,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Greatjon Umber,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2570,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2571,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Theon Greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2572,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Greatjon Umber,Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2573,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2574,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Have my horse saddled and ready.
2575,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Greatjon Umber,Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2576,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Theon Greyjoy,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2577,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
2578,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,l agree. l'll go.
2579,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Everyone,You can't!
2580,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2581,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Greatjon Umber,Unless there was a profit in it.
2582,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,What do you want?
2583,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2584,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2585,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Stevron Frey,"Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
2586,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2587,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Ryger Rivers,"Father, please –"
2588,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2589,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,ls there somewhere we can talk?
2590,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2591,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,l'm sure she will give you many sons.
2592,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2593,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"He is quite ill, my lord."
2594,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2595,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"My lord, l –"
2596,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2597,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,l'm sure there were reasons –
2598,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2599,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2600,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,Why should l let him?
2601,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2602,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2603,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,You swore an oath to my father.
2604,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2605,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,Why don't you?
2606,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Walder Frey,"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2607,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Voices Outside,And engage!
2608,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jeor Mormont,When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2609,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,"Soon, he says."
2610,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jeor Mormont,"Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2611,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,This is Valyrian steel.
2612,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jeor Mormont,"lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2613,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,"My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
2614,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jeor Mormont,"Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2615,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,"Yes, my lord."
2616,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jeor Mormont,"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2617,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2618,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jeor Mormont,"No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2619,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Unidentified Nights Watchers,Well done. Well done.
2620,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Nights Watcher,"You earned that, Snow."
2621,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Nights Watcher,Well done.
2622,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Pyp,"Go on, let's have a look."
2623,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,At what?
2624,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Grenn,The sword! Show us the sword.
2625,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,All,Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
2626,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Pyp,Let's have a look.
2627,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Grenn,Piss off.
2628,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Pyp,"Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2629,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Grenn,Look at its eyes.
2630,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,What is it?
2631,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Sam Tarly,l - l can't.
2632,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,You can't what?
2633,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Sam Tarly,l'm really not supposed to say.
2634,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
2635,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Sam Tarly,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2636,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,What? What about him?
2637,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Sam Tarly,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2638,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,l should be there. l should be with him.
2639,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Greatjon Umber,"lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2640,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Well? What did he say?
2641,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2642,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Huh.
2643,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2644,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,What does he want in return?
2645,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2646,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,"Fine, fine. And?"
2647,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2648,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,She won't be happy about that. And?
2649,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2650,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2651,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,l did.
2652,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,And?
2653,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,One was – Do you consent?
2654,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Can l refuse?
2655,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,Not if you want to cross.
2656,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Then l consent.
2657,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,Sam said you wanted to see me?
2658,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2659,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,No.
2660,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2661,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2662,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2663,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,Sam told you.
2664,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2665,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2666,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2667,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2668,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2669,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,Who are you?
2670,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2671,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jon Snow,You're Aemon Targaryen.
2672,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Maester Aemon,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."
2673,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
2674,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Khal Drogo,My horse…
2675,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Cohollo,Blood of my blood…
2676,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Khal Drogo,"No, l must ride."
2677,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2678,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2679,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2680,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2681,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,"You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2682,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2683,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,"The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2684,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2685,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,Hyah! Hyah!
2686,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Kevan Lannister,Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2687,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2688,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2689,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2690,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Kevan Lannister,"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2691,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Shagga likes axes.
2692,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2693,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2694,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Kevan Lannister,They do seem rather ferocious.
2695,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2696,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2697,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2698,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2699,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2700,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2701,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,l took her.
2702,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Took her? From whom?
2703,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2704,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2705,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,He said something.
2706,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2707,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2708,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Who are you?
2709,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Prostitute,Who would you like me to be?
2710,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,What did your mother call you?
2711,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Prostitute,Shae. What did your mother call you?
2712,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,My mother died giving birth to me.
2713,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2714,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,What sort of accent is that?
2715,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Foreign.
2716,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,For-
2717,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,What do you want from me?
2718,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2719,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,And what do l get?
2720,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2721,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Who told you this? Women you paid?
2722,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2723,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Let's start with your last night in this world.
2724,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,Khaleesi.
2725,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2726,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2727,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2728,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2729,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,l won't leave him.
2730,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2731,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2732,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2733,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,The wound has festered.
2734,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,"You did this, witch."
2735,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2736,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,"No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2737,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2738,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,"Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2739,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2740,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,"The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2741,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2742,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,l think you're right.
2743,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,You've saved me once more.
2744,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,And now you must save him.
2745,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2746,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2747,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2748,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Do it. Save him.
2749,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,There is a price.
2750,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,"You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2751,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2752,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,My death?
2753,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,"No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2754,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rakharo,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2755,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Kill her and you kill your khal.
2756,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rakharo,This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2757,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2758,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,Go. Now.
2759,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Take her and leave. Take her!
2760,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Mirri Maz Duur,"You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2761,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,No one will enter.
2762,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,Bring him back to me.
2763,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,l have to save him.
2764,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,This must not be.
2765,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,This must be.
2766,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Qotho,Witch.
2767,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rakharo,Nothing good will come of this.
2768,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,"No, you can't."
2769,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Irri,Khaleesi!
2770,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,"No further, horselord."
2771,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,Are you hurt?
2772,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,The baby –
2773,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,Hmm?
2774,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Daenerys Targaryen,is coming.
2775,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,Fetch the midwives.
2776,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rakharo,They will not come. They say she is cursed.
2777,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jorah Mormont,They'll come or l'll have their heads.
2778,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rakharo,The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2779,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,"Are you in agony, my lion?"
2780,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,No.
2781,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2782,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2783,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Just used to it.
2784,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,Drink.
2785,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Let's play a new game.
2786,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2787,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2788,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,Not if you win.
2789,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2790,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,What are you good at?
2791,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,l happen to be a great judge of character.
2792,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,This sounds like a boring game.
2793,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2794,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,l don't want to play this game.
2795,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2796,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,But my mother hit harder.
2797,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,You killed your first man before you were 12.
2798,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2799,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,You've been north of the Wall.
2800,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,What brought you up there?
2801,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,Work.
2802,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2803,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,l don't want to play.
2804,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2805,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Drink.
2806,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2807,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,And we've established the rules about lying?
2808,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Drink!
2809,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2810,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2811,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2812,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Are you sure –
2813,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,"Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2814,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2815,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,My turn.
2816,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2817,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Who were you in love with?
2818,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,That's not how the game works.
2819,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,l don't care the way the game works.
2820,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,Our lord here used to be married.
2821,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Married?
2822,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,How did you hear that?
2823,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2824,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Another night, perhaps."
2825,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,Not another night. This night.
2826,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,lt's not a pleasant story.
2827,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,"Oh, maybe l will cry."
2828,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2829,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2830,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
2831,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2832,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2833,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2834,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2835,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,You should have known she was a whore.
2836,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2837,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2838,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"As l said, l was young and stupid."
2839,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,You are still young and stupid.
2840,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,What is it? What do you want?
2841,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,You're sleeping through the war.
2842,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,What?
2843,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
2844,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Get my squire!
2845,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,You don't have a squire.
2846,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"lf l die, weep for me."
2847,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Shae,You'll be dead. How will you know?
2848,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,l'll know.
2849,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Lannister Soldier,Watch out! Move!
2850,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Lannister Soldier,Out of the way! Move aside!
2851,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,Stay low.
2852,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Stay low?
2853,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
2854,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
2855,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tribesmen Of Vale,Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
2856,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,To battle!
2857,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,You're a shit warrior.
2858,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,l'm alive?
2859,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,You're alive.
2860,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Did we win?
2861,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2862,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,How did our tribesmen do?
2863,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Bronn,"Yeah, good."
2864,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,lt's nice to see them getting along.
2865,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,You're wounded.
2866,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
2867,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
2868,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
2869,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,He wasn't here.
2870,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,Where was he?
2871,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tywin Lannister,"With his other 18,000 men."
2872,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Tyrion Lannister,And where are they?
2873,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rodrik Cassel,"We should go, my lady."
2874,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,No!
2875,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Rodrik Cassel,My lady!
2876,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Stark Bannermen,Hyah! Hyah!
2877,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
2878,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jaime Lannister,"Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
2879,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
2880,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jaime Lannister,"l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
2881,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Theon Greyjoy,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
2882,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,He's more use to us alive than dead.
2883,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Catelyn Stark,Take him away and put him in irons.
2884,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Jaime Lannister,"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
2885,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,"lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
2886,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Greatjon Umber,"Come on, pretty man."
2887,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,"l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
2888,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Theon Greyjoy,The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
2889,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Robb Stark,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
2890,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Arya Stark,Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
2891,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Kings Landing Baker,Three coppers.
2892,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Arya Stark,How about a nice fat pigeon?
2893,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Kings Landing Baker,"Oh, piss off now. Go on."
2894,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Arya Stark,Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
2895,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Kings Landing Baker,Piss off!
2896,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Arya Stark,"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
2897,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Street Urchin,They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
2898,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Arya Stark,Who?
2899,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Street Urchin,The Hand of the King.

2903,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Eddark Stark,"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
2904,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Grand Maester Pycelle,"As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
2905,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Joffrey Lannister,"My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
2906,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Sansa Stark,"No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
2907,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Cersei Lannister,"My son, this is madness."
2908,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Populace,Put him down!
2909,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Yoren,Don't look!
2910,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Arya Stark,Let me go.

2912,2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,Sansa Stark,"Stop him, stop!"
2913,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Yoren,"Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut."
2914,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Yoren,"Keep your mouth shut, boy."
2915,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Arya Stark,l'm not a boy!
2916,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Yoren,"You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north."
2917,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,"lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there."
2918,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Osha,"Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet."
2919,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
2920,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Osha,l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
2921,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
2922,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,"That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father."
2923,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Osha,You see? He's not here.
2924,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Rickon Stark,"Here, Shaggydog."
2925,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,Rickon!
2926,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Osha,That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
2927,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Rickon Stark,He doesn't like chains.
2928,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
2929,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Rickon Stark,"No, l came to see Father."
2930,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
2931,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Rickon Stark,He was down here. l saw him.
2932,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Bran Stark,Saw him when?

2934,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Osha,"You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –"

2961,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sansa Stark,"No! Please, no!"
2962,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
2963,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sansa Stark,You promised to be merciful.
2964,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
2965,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sansa Stark,"Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –"
2966,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,"Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!"
2967,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,Well?
2968,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sansa Stark,How long do l have to look?
2969,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
2970,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sansa Stark,lf it please Your Grace.
2971,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,"That's your Septa there. l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well."
2972,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sansa Stark,Or maybe he'll give me yours.
2973,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sandor Clegane,"Here, girl."
2974,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
2975,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sandor Clegane,"Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants."
2976,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sandor Clegane,You'll be needing that again.
2977,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jonos Bracken,The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
2978,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Robb Stark,Renly is not the king.
2979,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jonos Bracken,"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death."
2980,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Robb Stark,"That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
2981,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jonos Bracken,Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
2982,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Galbart Glover,Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
2983,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Greatjon Umber,"My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!"
2984,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Rickard Karstark,l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!
2985,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Theon Greyjoy,"Am l your brother, now and always?"
2986,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Robb Stark,Now and always.
2987,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Theon Greyjoy,"My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day."
2988,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Greatjon Umber,The King in the North!
2989,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,All,The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
2990,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Stark Guard,Lady Stark.
2991,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
2992,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,Leave us.
2993,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,"You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman."
2994,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,"l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
2995,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,"Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long."
2996,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,"That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death."
2997,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,"But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?"
2998,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,"Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
2999,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
3000,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,Because of men like you.
3001,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,There are no men like me. Only me.
3002,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
3003,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,l pushed him out the window.
3004,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Catelyn Stark,Why?
3005,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,I hoped the fall would kill him.
3006,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jaime Lannister,You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
3007,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Lancel Lannister,"l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?"
3008,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Cersei Lannister,Stop talking. Get back into bed.
3009,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tywin Lannister,They have my son.
3010,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
3011,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Leo Lefford,l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
3012,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Addam Marbrand,ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
3013,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Kevan Lannister,"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
3014,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
3015,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Kevan Lannister,l'm told we still have his sisters.
3016,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Leo Lefford,The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
3017,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Addam Marbrand,Kevan Lannister
3018,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tywin Lannister,"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
3019,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
3020,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tywin Lannister,No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
3021,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,And do what?
3022,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tywin Lannister,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
3023,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,"Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
3024,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tywin Lannister,"You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"
3025,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Ser Jorah?
3026,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,"Gently, gently."
3027,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
3028,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,The boy did not live.
3029,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Tell me.
3030,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,What is there to tell?
3031,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,How did my son die?
3032,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,"He never lived, my princess. The women say –"
3033,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,What do the women say?
3034,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,They say the child was –
3035,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,"Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
3036,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
3037,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,"As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."
3038,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,Time enough for that later –
3039,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,l want to see him now.
3040,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,The khalasar is gone.
3041,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,"A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."
3042,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?
3043,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
3044,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,"He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
3045,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,This is not life. When will he be as he was?
3046,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
3047,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Leave us.
3048,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
3049,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
3050,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
3051,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
3052,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent.
3053,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
3054,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,l spoke for you. l saved you.
3055,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,"Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
3056,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Your life.
3057,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
3058,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,You can't!
3059,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,"Get out of my way, Sam."
3060,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
3061,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,Better than you do.
3062,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,What are you going to do?
3063,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
3064,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,You can't leave us now. We need you here.
3065,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,Move.
3066,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,l won't let you go.
3067,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,No.
3068,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,Hyah!
3069,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,Hand of the King?
3070,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,So it would seem.
3071,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
3072,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,"No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
3073,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,He knew my name?
3074,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,What?
3075,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"
3076,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,"l believe he used the word ""whore""."
3077,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
3078,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,"I'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."
3079,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Tyrion Lannister,"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"
3080,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Shae,l know what a Hand needs.
3081,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,Ghost?
3082,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Pyp And Grenn,Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
3083,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,Samwell!
3084,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Pyp,ls he dead?
3085,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,"No, he's not dead."
3086,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,Did we get him?
3087,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,"Come on, help me get him up."
3088,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Pyp,Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.
3089,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,l belong with my brother.
3090,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,But we're your brothers now.
3091,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
3092,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
3093,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Pyp,Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
3094,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
3095,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,l have to.
3096,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,You can't. You said the words.
3097,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,I don't care about –
3098,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Tarly,Hear my words and bear witness to my vow
3099,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,To hell with all of you.
3100,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Pyp,Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
3101,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grenn,l am the sword in the darkness –
3102,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Sam Pyp And Grenn,"l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”"
3103,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,"Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars."
3104,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
3105,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grand Maester Pycelle,"Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."
3106,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grand Maester Pycelle,"He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness."
3107,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Ros,So what's the thing?
3108,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grand Maester Pycelle,What thing?
3109,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Ros,"About kings. You said, ""The thing you need to understand about kings""."
3110,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grand Maester Pycelle,What? Things? What?
3111,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Ros,"When you started, you… Never mind."
3112,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grand Maester Pycelle,"Let me see you out, my dear."
3113,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Ros,lt's all right. No need.
3114,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Grand Maester Pycelle,"Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right."
3115,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
3116,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
3117,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
3118,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
3119,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
3120,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
3121,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,"Oh, you can do better than that."
3122,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
3123,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
3124,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
3125,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
3126,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,"Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
3127,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
3128,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
3129,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,"And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
3130,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,"A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
3131,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
3132,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,Playing our roles.
3133,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,Serving a new King.
3134,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Petyr Baelish,Long may he reign. My king.
3135,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Varys,My king.
3136,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Joffrey Lannister,My lords. Shall we begin?
3137,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Yoren,"You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?"
3138,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Arya Stark,Arry.
3139,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Yoren,"You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time – men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."
3140,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Hot Pie,"Watch yourself, midget."
3141,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Lommy Greenhands,"He's got a sword, this one."
3142,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Hot Pie,What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
3143,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Lommy Greenhands,Maybe he's a little squire.
3144,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Hot Pie,He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
3145,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Lommy Greenhands,Let's have a look.
3146,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Hot Pie,l could use me a sword like that.
3147,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Lommy Greenhands,Take it off him.
3148,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Hot Pie,"Give it here, midget."
3149,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Lommy Greenhands,Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
3150,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Hot Pie,l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
3151,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Arya Stark,You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
3152,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Gendry Baratheon,"Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?"
3153,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Arya Stark,lt was a gift.
3154,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Gendry Baratheon,"lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers."
3155,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Arya Stark,Which are you?
3156,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Gendry Baratheon,"Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am."
3157,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Yoren,"Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!"
3158,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jeor Mormont,Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
3159,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,My friends brought me back.
3160,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jeor Mormont,l didn't say it was your honor.
3161,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,They killed my father.
3162,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jeor Mormont,"And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"
3163,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,No.
3164,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jeor Mormont,"When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?"
3165,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jeor Mormont,Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
3166,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jon Snow,Beyond the Wall?
3167,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jeor Mormont,"l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
3168,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Rakharo,"ls this your command, Khaleesi?"
3169,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
3170,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,They were not given to me to sell.
3171,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,"Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not."
3172,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,l must. You don't understand.
3173,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
3174,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,"ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."
3175,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,"Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me."
3176,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Mirri Maz Duur,You will not hear me scream.
3177,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
3178,2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,Jorah Mormont,Blood of my blood.
3179,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Well struck… Well struck, Dog."

3181,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sansa Stark,"It was well struck, Your Grace."
3182,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,I already said it was well struck.
3183,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sansa Stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
3184,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,Who's next?
3185,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Announcer,"Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish."
3186,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Announcer,Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
3187,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Announcer,Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
3188,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Ser Dontos,"Here I am. . Here I am. . Sorry, Your Grace. . My deepest apologies. ."
3189,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,Are you drunk?
3190,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Ser Dontos,"No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine."
3191,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Two cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup."
3192,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Ser Dontos,"Are you sure, Your Grace?"
3193,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Yes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you like."
3194,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Ser Dontos,"I would be honored, Your Grace."
3195,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill."
3196,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sansa Stark,You can't!
3197,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,What did you say? Did you say I can't?
3198,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sansa Stark,I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
3199,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
3200,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sandor Clegane,"The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."
3201,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool."
3202,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sansa Stark,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
3203,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool."
3204,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Ser Dontos,"Thank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you."
3205,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Beloved nephew.
3206,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.
3207,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
3208,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me."
3209,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bronn,Can't imagine why.
3210,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,We heard you were dead.
3211,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Myrcella,I'm glad you're not dead.
3212,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
3213,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
3214,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
3215,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sansa Stark,"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
3216,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Of course you are.
3217,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
3218,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,What work? . Why are you here?
3219,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Pycelle,"The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
3220,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Varys,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
3221,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Pycelle,A common superstition.
3222,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants."
3223,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,"The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse."
3224,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
3225,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,"I do, Your Grace."
3226,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,And are you not a Lord at my command?
3227,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
3228,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
3229,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,"Yes, Your Grace."
3230,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
3231,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,What are you doing here?
3232,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
3233,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
3234,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
3235,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Our father is Hand of the King.
3236,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, but in his absence…"
3237,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
3238,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
3239,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
3240,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,I've done nothing.
3241,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
3242,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,I tried to stop it.
3243,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
3244,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Robb Stark is a child.
3245,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
3246,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,What do you know about warfare?
3247,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
3248,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Joffrey is King.
3249,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Joffrey is King.
3250,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,You are here to advise him.
3251,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
3252,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,How?
3253,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
3254,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,One.
3255,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,One?
3256,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
3257,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
3258,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3259,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord,"The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
3260,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Luwin,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
3261,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord,"Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
3262,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
3263,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord,"Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
3264,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
3265,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord,Of course I remember!
3266,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Luwin,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
3267,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord,I - I believe it will.
3268,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Luwin,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
3269,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
3270,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Luwin,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.
3271,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Portan,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
3272,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Osha,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
3273,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,Don't have any pain.
3274,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Osha,Lucky for you.
3275,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,That way.
3276,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Osha,You've been having those dreams again.
3277,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,I don't dream.
3278,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Osha,Everyone dreams.
3279,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
3280,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Osha,"Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
3281,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Osha,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
3282,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Bran Stark,The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
3283,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Doreah,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
3284,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,He said they ate meat.
3285,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Doreah,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
3286,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
3287,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
3288,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jorah Mormont,I remember.
3289,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
3290,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jorah Mormont,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
3291,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,Does it ever end?
3292,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jorah Mormont,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
3293,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,And you're sure there's no other way?
3294,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jorah Mormont,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
3295,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,No one will take my dragons.
3296,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jorah Mormont,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
3297,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,As you are mine.
3298,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
3299,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Rakharo,"What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
3300,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3301,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,"Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
3302,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Rakharo,"I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
3303,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daenerys Targaryen,You never have.
3304,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Rakharo,This is… bad time to start.
3305,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,Having a rough time of it?
3306,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sam,Nothing's killed me yet.
3307,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Grenn,Your ass killed the sledge.
3308,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sam,You offered me a ride!
3309,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Grenn,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
3310,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Edd,"I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
3311,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sam,Are those girls?
3312,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Edd,Craster's daughters.
3313,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sam,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
3314,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Edd,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
3315,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Grenn,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
3316,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Edd,He don't like people messing with his wives.
3317,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Edd,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes."
3318,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sam,That's foul.
3319,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Grenn,It's beyond foul.
3320,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Edd,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
3321,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,What happens to the boys?
3322,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Sam,Hmm?
3323,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
3324,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
3325,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
3326,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,We're not Southerners.
3327,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
3328,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,Jon Snow.
3329,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
3330,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,The lad meant no harm.
3331,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
3332,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
3333,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,You bring any of that good wine with you?
3334,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
3335,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
3336,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
3337,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Watchman,"Yes, commander."
3338,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
3339,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,"He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
3340,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
3341,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
3342,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
3343,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,Give it here.
3344,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,You'll have another one made at Castle Black. . Here.
3345,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Oh, that's some lovely steel. . You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings."
3346,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,And where does he plan marching this army?
3347,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
3348,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
3349,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
3350,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Gilly,This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
3351,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
3352,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,We chose different paths.
3353,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
3354,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
3355,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Craster,"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."
3356,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,"Your roof, your rules."
3357,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,Who am I? Who am I?
3358,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,Lord commander.
3359,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,And who are you?
3360,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,Who are you?
3361,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jon Snow,Your steward.
3362,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Lord Mormont,You want to lead one day? . Then learn how to follow.
3363,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,"Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods."
3364,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3365,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Group,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3366,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,"After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed."
3367,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cressen,We need to stop her!
3368,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
3369,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,Not now.
3370,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,And the dead shall rise in the North.
3371,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cressen,All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
3372,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,"You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me."
3373,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,"In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you."

3377,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cressen,This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
3378,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,"Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
3379,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cressen,"King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
3380,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
3381,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cressen,"As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. . If you tell him the truth…"
3382,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,What's the truth?
3383,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Matthos,And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
3384,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Stannis Baratheon,"He wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
3385,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
3386,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Stannis Baratheon,A lie. Take it out.
3387,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Matthos,"That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"""
3388,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Stannis Baratheon,"Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is."
3389,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Matthos,"And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"
3390,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Stannis Baratheon,"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
3391,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Matthos,"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. . Let all true men declare their loyalty.”"
3392,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Stannis Baratheon,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
3393,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
3394,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Stannis Baratheon,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
3395,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
3396,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
3397,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
3398,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,He has no need for ships.
3399,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."

I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."

3402,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Davos,Don't.
3403,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cressen,A cup of wine to honor the one true God.
3404,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Melisandre,"The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace."
3405,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
3406,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
3407,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
3408,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
3409,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?
3410,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
3411,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.
3412,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
3413,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
3414,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
3415,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
3416,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
3417,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
3418,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
3419,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"No, but he's starting to know me."
3420,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Jaime Lannister,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
3421,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,It's better than three defeats.
3422,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,This city stinks Like dead bodies.
3423,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"A bit corpsey, yes."
3424,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,And shit.
3425,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,I thought you wanted to come here.
3426,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,I love it.
3427,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
3428,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,And cum and garlic and rum.
3429,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,You can smell cum from the balcony?
3430,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
3431,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,And so did the country.
3432,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,This is where I belong.
3433,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
3434,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,No one will know.
3435,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
3436,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,What about you?
3437,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
3438,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Shae,Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
3439,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
3440,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Tyrion Lannister,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
3441,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Lord Baelish.
3442,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,Your Grace.
3443,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
3444,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
3445,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
3446,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
3447,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
3448,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,Curious.
3449,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
3450,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?"
3451,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
3452,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,Yes.
3453,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
3454,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
3455,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
3456,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
3457,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,And which truth is that?
3458,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Petyr Baelish,Knowledge is power.
3459,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
3460,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
3461,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Alton,"I am, Your Grace."
3462,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
3463,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Alton,"An honorable request, Your Grace."
3464,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
3465,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Ser Rodrik,The King in the North.
3466,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Others At Table,King in the North.
3467,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
3468,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Alton,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
3469,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
3470,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Alton,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
3471,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
3472,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Theon Greyjoy,"A word, Your Grace?"
3473,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
3474,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Theon Greyjoy,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
3475,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
3476,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Theon Greyjoy,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
3477,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,Of course they are.
3478,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Theon Greyjoy,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
3479,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,Men who fought my father.
3480,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Theon Greyjoy,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
3481,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3482,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
3483,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
3484,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
3485,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
3486,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
3487,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
3488,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
3489,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
3490,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
3491,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
3492,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,You can't go to Winterfell.
3493,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,I beg your pardon?
3494,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
3495,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,Why in the name of all the Gods -
3496,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
3497,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
3498,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
3499,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,I will ride at first light.
3500,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
3501,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
3502,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Robb Stark,Give Lord Renly my regards.
3503,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Catelyn Stark,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
3504,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,What is all this?
3505,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
3506,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,We can't find Arya Stark.
3507,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
3508,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
3509,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
3510,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
3511,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
3512,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,His life is in danger.
3513,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
3514,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
3515,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
3516,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
3517,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
3518,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Cersei Lannister,What are you asking?
3519,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
3520,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Joffrey Lannister,"What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. . That will be all, Mother."
3521,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,"No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion."
3522,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
3523,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,"We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall."
3524,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daisy,Haystack Hall.
3525,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. . Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
3526,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daisy,Littlefinger's a fancy man.
3527,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,"Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish."
3528,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
3529,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Daisy,She's beautiful.
3530,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,"She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. . Lord Commander. Good to see you, again."
3531,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,"You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets."
3532,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Orders.
3533,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Roz,Whose orders?
3534,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
3535,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Mhaegan,"No, you can't!"
3536,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Mhaegan,No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
3537,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
3538,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Give it here.
3539,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Gold Cloak,"Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room."
3540,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Blacksmith,Gendry! His name is Gendry.
3541,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Where is the bastard?
3542,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Blacksmith,"The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
3543,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Where?
3544,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Blacksmith,"They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
3545,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,How will we know him?
3546,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Blacksmith,He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.
3547,2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,Janos,Find him.
3548,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cold,OPEN
3549,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,What are you doing here?
3550,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead.
3551,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,You brought this on yourself.
3552,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,I've done nothing.
3553,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Do you understand we're losing the war?
3554,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,Does it ever end?
3555,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jorah Mormont,"Everything ends, even the red waste."
3556,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
3557,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Edd,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here.
3558,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Craster,"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand."
3559,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Edd,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters."
3560,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?
3561,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,"My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros."
3562,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.
3563,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Robb Stark,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
3564,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jaime Lannister,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
3565,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"We won't beat them until we take King's Landing, and we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them."

3567,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me.
3568,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Catelyn Stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
3569,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Robb Stark,I need his ships.
3570,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Catelyn Stark,He is not trustworthy!
3571,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Joffrey Lannister,I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?
3572,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,What are you asking?
3573,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Joffrey Lannister,How many bastards does he have running around?
3574,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,Where is the bastard?

3580,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,What do you want?
3581,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jaqen Hghar,A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
3582,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,I have friends.
3583,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Rorge,Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
3584,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jaqen Hghar,"A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. . You're called Arry. . This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath."
3585,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Rorge,"Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!"
3586,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,You should have asked nicely.
3587,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Rorge,Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
3588,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jaqen Hghar,The boy has more courage than sense.
3589,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Rorge,Come here!
3590,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
3591,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,They don't scare me.
3592,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
3593,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
3594,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,What are you doing?
3595,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,They're looking for me.
3596,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gold Cloak,You're in command here?
3597,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yoren,You're a long way from home.
3598,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gold Cloak,I asked you a question.
3599,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yoren,"Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer."
3600,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gold Cloak,I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
3601,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yoren,"Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
3602,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yoren,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
3603,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yoren,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
3604,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gold Cloak,We're looking for a boy named Gendry. . He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
3605,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,My lord.
3606,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Shae,"You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
3607,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
3608,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,It was quite a battle.
3609,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
3610,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Shae,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
3611,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
3612,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
3613,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Shae,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
3614,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,How can you tell?
3615,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Shae,I can always tell.
3616,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
3617,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
3618,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
3619,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
3620,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,I don't like threats.
3621,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,Who threatened you?
3622,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
3623,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
3624,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
3625,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
3626,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
3627,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
3628,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
3629,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Alton,"I will, Your Grace."
3630,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
3631,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Alton,"I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
3632,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
3633,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Safe travels, cousin."
3634,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
3635,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,If that's everything?
3636,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Pycelle,A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
3637,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,Trouble with the wildlings?
3638,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,That's why they're called wildlings.
3639,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
3640,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
3641,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
3642,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
3643,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
3644,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Pycelle,The northerners are a superstitious people.
3645,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
3646,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Varys,How do you kill a dead man?
3647,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Apparently you burn him.
3648,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
3649,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
3650,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
3651,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Edd,"Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
3652,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Grenn,We fart when we die?
3653,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Edd,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
3654,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
3655,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Edd,We were having a serious discussion.
3656,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Grenn,Would you look at that.
3657,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
3658,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Grenn,I prefer watching them come towards me.
3659,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,I'm sure that's nice too.
3660,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Grenn,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed."
3661,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,You were with her? How many times?
3662,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Grenn,"Well, as many times as I could."
3663,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
3664,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Edd,We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. . Get the turnips too.
3665,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam Tarly,"No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?"
3666,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gilly,You shouldn't touch me.
3667,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. ."
3668,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gilly,You're very brave.
3669,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,What're you doing?
3670,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
3671,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?"
3672,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gilly,Sam said you could help.
3673,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
3674,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave."
3675,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,What? .
3676,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,I know it sounds a bit mad.
3677,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
3678,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -"
3679,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,Sam we can't take her -
3680,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gilly,"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
3681,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,It's just not possible.
3682,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gilly,"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
3683,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
3684,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,Why did you do that?
3685,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"Do what, ask her a question?"
3686,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,You were cruel.
3687,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
3688,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,I didn't touch her!
3689,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
3690,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
3691,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
3692,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Sam,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
3693,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jon Snow,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
3694,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jorah Mormont,Khaleesi.
3695,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jorah Mormont,You don't need to see this.
3696,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,He is blood of my blood.
3697,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,Who did this?
3698,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Jorah Mormont,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
3699,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
3700,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Irri,No! They killed his soul!
3701,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
3702,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Irri,They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
3703,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
3704,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Daenerys Targaryen,"And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
3705,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,Is it as you remember my lord?
3706,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Looks smaller.
3707,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,"Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
3708,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
3709,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,Who will?
3710,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
3711,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,I love the cold and wet.
3712,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
3713,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,Then you'll be king before long.
3714,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better."
3715,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
3716,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I don't blame him.
3717,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,"He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-"
3718,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
3719,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
3720,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Your place is on this ship.
3721,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Woman,Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
3722,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I haven't paid you.
3723,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Man,"I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
3724,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
3725,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
3726,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Roz,"I'm sorry, my lord."
3727,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
3728,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Roz,"No, my lord… It's Mhaegen."
3729,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,Who?
3730,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Roz,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
3731,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
3732,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Roz,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
3733,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Petyr Baelish,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."
3734,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Podrick,More wine?
3735,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,"Damn it, boy!"
3736,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Podrick,"Apologies, my lord."
3737,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
3738,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
3739,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
3740,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
3741,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"You know your wines, my lord."
3742,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
3743,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
3744,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
3745,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Wars have been started for less.
3746,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
3747,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
3748,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
3749,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,Orders are orders.
3750,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
3751,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,I never said they were the queen's orders.
3752,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
3753,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,You know your sister better than I do.
3754,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
3755,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,I don't listen to filth.
3756,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
3757,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. ."
3758,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
3759,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
3760,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
3761,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
3762,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
3763,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
3764,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
3765,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
3766,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
3767,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
3768,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
3769,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"No, we shan't."
3770,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
3771,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Bronn,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
3772,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
3773,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
3774,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Bronn,Boys?
3775,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Janos,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
3776,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,To the new Commander.
3777,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
3778,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Bronn,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
3779,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Lommy,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
3780,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,I'm not afraid of no battles.
3781,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
3782,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
3783,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,Liar.
3784,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
3785,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Lommy,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
3786,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,They had armor on.
3787,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,So?
3788,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
3789,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Lommy,"No, it isn't."
3790,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
3791,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
3792,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,It's when they've got armor on.
3793,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,Now who told you that.
3794,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,A knight?
3795,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,How'd you know he was a knight?
3796,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,"Well, cause he got armor on."
3797,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
3798,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Hot Pie,How'd you know?
3799,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,Cause I sold armor.
3800,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
3801,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,No idea.
3802,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,You're a liar.
3803,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
3804,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
3805,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"Well, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions."
3806,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
3807,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
3808,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,Who asked questions?
3809,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
3810,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,Lord Stark.
3811,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
3812,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,What did they ask about?
3813,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,My mom.
3814,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,Who's your mom?
3815,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
3816,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,And who was your father?
3817,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
3818,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,I'm not a girl!
3819,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
3820,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
3821,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,That's true. You're still a girl.
3822,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,I am not!
3823,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
3824,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
3825,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,They won't. Not from me.
3826,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
3827,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
3828,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
3829,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
3830,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
3831,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"You were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
3832,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Arya Stark,Do not call me milady.
3833,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Gendry Baratheon,"As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike."
3834,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Man,What you carrying?
3835,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
3836,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Man,Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .
3837,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I need to get to Pyke.
3838,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Man,I'll find you a horse.
3839,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
3840,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I bet you can.
3841,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
3842,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,None like you.
3843,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,You don't know what I'm like.
3844,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
3845,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
3846,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Have my things sent up to the castle.
3847,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
3848,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
3849,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
3850,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
3851,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
3852,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,Is that an offer from my future king?
3853,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
3854,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
3855,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Father.
3856,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
3857,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,A man. Your blood and your heir.
3858,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
3859,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Lord Stark is gone.
3860,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,And how do you feel about that?
3861,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
3862,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
3863,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
3864,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
3865,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Gold.
3866,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
3867,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,My blood is salt and iron.
3868,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,"Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
3869,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
3870,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,He heeds your counsel?
3871,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
3872,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,"No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
3873,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
3874,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
3875,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I will lead the attack myself.
3876,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,"Oh, you will?"
3877,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
3878,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
3879,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
3880,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,My dear.
3881,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,Yara?
3882,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
3883,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,She can't lead an attack!
3884,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,And why not?
3885,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,You're a woman!
3886,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Yara Greyjoy,You're the one in skirts.
3887,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
3888,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,All Three,What's dead may never die.
3889,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
3890,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Theon Greyjoy,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
3891,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Balon,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
3892,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
3893,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
3894,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
3895,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
3896,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
3897,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
3898,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,"Mind your words, pirate. ."
3899,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Matthos.
3900,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
3901,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
3902,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,That's a promise that always comes true.
3903,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
3904,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,Only the clever ones.
3905,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
3906,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
3907,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,It is. .
3908,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"One thing, I want the queen."
3909,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,The queen?
3910,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
3911,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
3912,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
3913,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,As if she would just let you!
3914,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
3915,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
3916,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
3917,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
3918,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
3919,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,You believe your king can win?
3920,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,He is the one true king.
3921,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Saan,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
3922,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
3923,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,When will the King have a sail?
3924,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,As soon as his God wills it.
3925,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read."
3926,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Oh you and your mother.
3927,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
3928,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
3929,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,But you always came home.
3930,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,I wasn't praying.
3931,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,"But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
3932,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
3933,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,"Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
3934,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Don't tell him that.
3935,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
3936,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
3937,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
3938,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
3939,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
3940,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
3941,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
3942,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
3943,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
3944,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
3945,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
3946,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
3947,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Tyrion Lannister,She was my mother too.
3948,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Cersei Lannister,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
3949,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Your Grace.
3950,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Matthos,Your Grace.
3951,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,How did it fare with your pirate?
3952,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
3953,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
3954,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Does seem the wiser choice.
3955,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
3956,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
3957,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
3958,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,"At once, Your Grace."
3959,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
3960,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Davos,Come.
3961,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,What did you say to him?
3962,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
3963,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,Why?
3964,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
3965,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,Yeah.
3966,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
3967,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,Tell your lord to burn them then.
3968,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
3969,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
3970,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,You must have faith.
3971,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
3972,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,Then we must be the ten.
3973,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
3974,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
3975,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
3976,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,You must give... all of yourself.
3977,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,I have a wife. I took a vow.
3978,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Melisandre,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."
3979,2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,Stannis Baratheon,A son?
3980,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Craster,"Out, all of you."
3981,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Craster,This bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!
3982,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Craster,I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
3983,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,Wait outside.
3984,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jon Snow,Lord Commander-
3985,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,Now!
3986,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sam,Lord Commander-
3987,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,Leave us.
3988,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,What did you do?
3989,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jon Snow,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
3990,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,What business is that of yours?
3991,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jon Snow,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
3992,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jon Snow,You know.
3993,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
3994,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jon Snow,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
3995,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
3996,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jon Snow,I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
3997,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,"Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."
3998,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Jeor,Don't lose it again.
3999,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sam,Gilly.
4000,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gilly,You're leaving.
4001,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sam,"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
4002,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gilly,I can't take it.
4003,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sam,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
4004,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gilly,"You, you shouldn't give it away."
4005,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sam,I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
4006,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sam,Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
4007,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Hodor,Hodor.
4008,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Luwin,"Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
4009,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Bran Stark,Every night it's the same.
4010,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Bran Stark,"I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
4011,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Luwin,"That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories."
4012,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Bran Stark,So she was lying? They don't exist?
4013,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Luwin,"Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
4014,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Bran Stark,"No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
4015,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Luwin,What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
4016,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Luwin,"This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
4017,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Luwin,All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
4018,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,Loras! Highgarden!
4019,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Man,Get him!
4020,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Crowd,Oh!
4021,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,Yield! I yield.
4022,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Well fought. Approach.
4023,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Rise. Remove your helm.
4024,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion."
4025,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,"Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
4026,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."
4027,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Brienne,"Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
4028,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,What?
4029,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Brienne,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
4030,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
4031,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Colen,"Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
4032,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
4033,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
4034,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,"You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
4035,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,You are most kind.
4036,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head."
4037,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
4038,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Brienne,Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
4039,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
4040,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
4041,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
4042,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,"If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts."
4043,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
4044,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning."
4045,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gerard,Your Grace.
4046,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Gerard. How's your foot?
4047,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gerard,"Better, Your Grace."
4048,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gerard,They don't know their own size is all.
4049,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Good man.
4050,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
4051,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
4052,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Why?
4053,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
4054,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."
4055,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Brienne,"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
4056,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
4057,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Brienne,"If you'll follow me, my lady."
4058,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Catelyn Stark,"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
4059,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Brienne,"I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
4060,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,What are you doing here?
4061,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
4062,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,You lying bitch.
4063,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
4064,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
4065,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,"You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
4066,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,Why didn't you tell me?
4067,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
4068,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
4069,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,Father.
4070,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,Father.
4071,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,"The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
4072,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,"Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
4073,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,I've always wanted a castle.
4074,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,And what's my role in all this?
4075,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
4076,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
4077,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
4078,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,I'm to fight fishermen?
4079,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,Be careful of their nets.
4080,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
4081,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
4082,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
4083,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
4084,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
4085,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,What are our words? Our words?
4086,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,We do not sow.
4087,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon,We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
4088,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
4089,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,You gave me away!
4090,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
4091,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
4092,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,I have no other family.
4093,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yara Greyjoy,"Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
4094,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
4095,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Keep your voice down.
4096,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
4097,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
4098,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Again, only temporary."
4099,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
4100,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
4101,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Scullion? What is a scullion?
4102,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Kitchen wench.
4103,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,A kitchen wench?
4104,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, but-"
4105,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
4106,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
4107,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,I'm the weakness?
4108,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"It's a compliment, my lady."
4109,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,How is being a weakness a compliment?
4110,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Language can be a bit tricky here.
4111,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,"Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench."
4112,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Myrcella,When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
4113,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
4114,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Myrcella,"Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
4115,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,The princess just spoke to you.
4116,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,"Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
4117,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tommen Lannister,Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
4118,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,He might.
4119,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,Would you like that?
4120,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tommen Lannister,No. I don't think so.
4121,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
4122,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Come in.
4123,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Who are you?
4124,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,"I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
4125,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
4126,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,No.
4127,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,What are you doing?
4128,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
4129,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
4130,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,What things?
4131,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
4132,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,No.
4133,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,You said to brush your-
4134,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Not now.
4135,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Your chamber pot is empty.
4136,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Clean the table.
4137,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
4138,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Yes.
4139,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,For whom?
4140,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Lady Zuriff.
4141,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Lady Zuriff
4142,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
4143,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,She wasn't in this city.
4144,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,"I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
4145,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Shae,Do you want me to leave?
4146,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa Stark,Just brush my hair.
4147,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
4148,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
4149,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
4150,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Please.
4151,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Thank you, my lord."
4152,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
4153,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Why, yes, of course, my lord."
4154,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
4155,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Matrimony, huh? Yes."
4156,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
4157,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
4158,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
4159,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
4160,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
4161,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
4162,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
4163,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
4164,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Precisely.
4165,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
4166,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"But remember, you must tell no one."
4167,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,Tell no one what?
4168,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
4169,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
4170,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
4171,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
4172,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Who better?
4173,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
4174,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
4175,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,Harrenhal is cursed.
4176,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
4177,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
4178,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
4179,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
4180,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
4181,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Good. Oh. And remember-
4182,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,The Queen mustn't know.
4183,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,That must hurt.
4184,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,What? What is it?
4185,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
4186,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Brienne is a very capable warrior.
4187,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
4188,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
4189,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,I'll make it up to you.
4190,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,"No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
4191,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
4192,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,And Margaery's a virgin?
4193,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras,Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
4194,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
4195,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,As is your right. You are a king.
4196,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,You look very beautiful.
4197,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,"Thank you, Your Grace."
4198,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,It's a lovely gown.
4199,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,"You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
4200,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,You certainly don't need it.
4201,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,"Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
4202,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,Must be the wine.
4203,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,"Here, let me."
4204,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,I'm sorry.
4205,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,Do you want my brother to come in and help?
4206,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,What?
4207,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
4208,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Renly,I don't know what you're talking about.
4209,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
4210,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,"Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
4211,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell,Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
4212,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
4213,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
4214,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
4215,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Dorne is the safest place for her.
4216,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
4217,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
4218,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,She'll be a hostage.
4219,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,A guest.
4220,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
4221,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"It's done, Cersei."
4222,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,No.
4223,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,You cannot stop it.
4224,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,No!
4225,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
4226,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Cersei Lannister,Get out! Get out!
4227,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Priest,"Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
4228,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,I would.
4229,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Drowned Priest,Kneel.
4230,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Drowned Priest,"Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
4231,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Theon Greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
4232,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Drowned Priest,What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
4233,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
4234,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
4235,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
4236,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
4237,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,Leave me out of your next deception.
4238,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
4239,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Petyr Baelish,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
4240,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
4241,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Find him?
4242,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Bronn,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
4243,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"No, you don't."
4244,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Bronn,"No, I don't."
4245,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,What is the meaning of this?
4246,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"No, please, please."
4247,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
4248,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,I am your loyal servant.
4249,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
4250,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
4251,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
4252,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,The eunuch has spies everywhere.
4253,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
4254,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"No, no, no."
4255,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Timett,"There are no goats, halfman."
4256,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, make do."
4257,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,How long have you been spying for my sister?
4258,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
4259,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,I don't like his beard.
4260,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,What? What?
4261,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Oh, no. No."
4262,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
4263,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
4264,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,So you poisoned him?
4265,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,No. Never.
4266,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
4267,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Lannister, I always served Lannister."
4268,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
4269,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pycelle,"Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
4270,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,For your trouble.
4271,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
4272,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Good. One of my better ideas.
4273,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
4274,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
4275,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
4276,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
4277,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
4278,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
4279,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,Depends on the sellsword.
4280,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
4281,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
4282,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
4283,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion Lannister,I've decided I don't like riddles.
4284,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Varys,"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
4285,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
4286,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,I can't sleep.
4287,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,I don't like the taste.
4288,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
4289,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,What?
4290,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,How do you sleep?
4291,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Same as most men, I think."
4292,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
4293,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
4294,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
4295,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
4296,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
4297,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
4298,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
4299,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gendry Baratheon,Get up.
4300,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,Get up.
4301,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Keep out of sight, both of you."
4302,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Arya Stark,"No, I'm not afraid."
4303,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gendry Baratheon,I can fight.
4304,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
4305,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren,"Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
4306,2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Man,"Come on, move, move!"
4307,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
4308,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
4309,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,"If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
4310,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,If he ever gets out.
4311,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,Loras Tyrell?
4312,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
4313,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
4314,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,"How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
4315,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
4316,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,They get spooked by their own shadows.
4317,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,Shh. Do you hear that?
4318,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,No.
4319,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,There's something out there.
4320,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,"Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
4321,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,"I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
4322,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,There is something out there.
4323,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,"Yeah, don't even try me."
4324,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,Rennick.
4325,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Rennick,Do you think I'm an idiot?
4326,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Guard,Rennick!
4327,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,King in the North!
4328,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Men,The King in the North!
4329,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Roose Bolton,Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
4330,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
4331,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Roose Bolton,"Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
4332,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,I doubt it.
4333,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Roose Bolton,"Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
4334,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,My father outlawed flaying in the North.
4335,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Roose Bolton,We're not in the North.
4336,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,We're not torturing them.
4337,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Roose Bolton,"The high roado s very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it."
4338,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
4339,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,"No, don't! Don't! Please!"
4340,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,Shhh.
4341,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,The rot's set in.
4342,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,"No, don't! No, don't!"
4343,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,Shh.
4344,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,"Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."
4345,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
4346,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,"No, you can't!"
4347,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,"Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-"
4348,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,You'll die if she doesn't.
4349,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,"I don't want to be a cripple, please."
4350,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Roose Bolton,Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
4351,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,"Your men are not my men, my lord."
4352,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
4353,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Wounded Soldier,No! You can't!
4354,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
4355,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,What's your name?
4356,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,Talisa.
4357,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,Your last name?
4358,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,You want to know what side my family fights on?
4359,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
4360,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,That boy lost his foot on your orders.
4361,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,They killed my father.
4362,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,That boy did?
4363,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,The family he fights for.
4364,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
4365,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,I have no hatred for the lad.
4366,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,That should help his foot grow back.
4367,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
4368,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,You're going to kill Joffrey?
4369,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,If the gods give me strength.
4370,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,And then what?
4371,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
4372,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,So who will?
4373,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,I don't know.
4374,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,"You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
4375,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,First we have to win the war.
4376,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,You never told me where you're from.
4377,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,Volantis.
4378,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Robb Stark,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
4379,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Talisa,He was unlucky that you were.
4380,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
4381,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Sansa Stark,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
4382,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
4383,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
4384,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Killing you would send your brother a message.
4385,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
4386,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
4387,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
4388,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
4389,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,What is the meaning of this?
4390,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
4391,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Meryn,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
4392,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Bronn,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
4393,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
4394,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,I'm punishing her.
4395,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
4396,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
4397,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
4398,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Meryn,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
4399,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
4400,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
4401,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Sansa Stark,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
4402,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
4403,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Bronn,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
4404,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
4405,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Bronn,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
4406,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,"What are you doing here, dog?"
4407,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Sandor Clegane,Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
4408,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,And? What is it?
4409,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Sandor Clegane,"Look inside, Your Grace."
4410,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daisy,Your Grace.
4411,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Ros,"Happy nameday, Your Grace."
4412,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,My nameday has passed.
4413,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Ros,We won't tell if you won't.
4414,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,No. Her. Touch her.
4415,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Could you hit her?
4416,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,My uncle sent you?
4417,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daisy,"Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
4418,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Ros,Hmm.
4419,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Use this.
4420,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Harder.
4421,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
4422,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Ros,"Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
4423,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daisy,"Please, Your Grace."
4424,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Ros,"Your Grace, if your uncle finds out"
4425,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,"Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you."
4426,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Begin.
4427,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Joffrey Lannister,Harder!
4428,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long."
4429,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,Your Grace.
4430,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
4431,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,I'm a practical man.
4432,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,Just not a loyal one.
4433,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
4434,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
4435,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
4436,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
4437,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
4438,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,I would give priority to my head.
4439,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
4440,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,Lord Baelish.
4441,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
4442,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,"It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
4443,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
4444,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,"I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
4445,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
4446,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
4447,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
4448,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,You seem quite interested in our marriage.
4449,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
4450,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,"You've never married, have you?"
4451,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
4452,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Margaery Tyrell,"That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
4453,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,This isn't your horse.
4454,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Kovarro,It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
4455,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,Qarth?
4456,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Kovarro,"Three days to the east, on the sea."
4457,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,Will they let us in?
4458,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Kovarro,They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
4459,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,What do you know of this place?
4460,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Jorah Mormont,"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
4461,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,Go on!
4462,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,"You, keep moving!"
4463,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,Bring her about!
4464,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Hot Pie,What kind of fire melts stone?
4465,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,Dragonfire.
4466,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Hot Pie,There's dragons here?
4467,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Gendry Baratheon,"No, all the dragons are dead."
4468,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Hot Pie,What's that smell?
4469,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,Dead people.
4470,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Soldier,Move.
4471,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,"Please, please, no, no! No."
4472,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Woman,"He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."
4473,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Gendry Baratheon,They take someone every day?
4474,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,Does anyone live?
4475,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
4476,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,How dare you?
4477,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,You may have heard false reports.
4478,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,You betrayed Ned.
4479,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
4480,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
4481,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"No, my lady."
4482,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,Get out!
4483,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
4484,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,Have you lost your mind? Get out!
4485,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
4486,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,"You have Arya, too?"
4487,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
4488,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,What do you want?
4489,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
4490,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
4491,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
4492,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,You think I keep secrets from my son?
4493,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
4494,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
4495,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,Good faith?
4496,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,What's this?
4497,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Petyr Baelish,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
4498,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,Get out.
4499,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,"Get up, you dogs!"
4500,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Hot Pie,"That's him, the one who picks."
4501,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,The Mountain. What are you doing?
4502,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Hot Pie,He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
4503,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Mountain,You.
4504,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Soldier,"Move, boy! Move!"
4505,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Is there gold and silver in the village?
4506,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,I don't know.
4507,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Gems?
4508,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,I didn't see any.
4509,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Where is the Brotherhood?
4510,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,I don't know. Please.
4511,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Which of the villagers aided them?
4512,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Who?
4513,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,I-
4514,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,"I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-"
4515,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
4516,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Who helped him?
4517,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,"Ganes, the butcher, and his son."
4518,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,That's better. You've been very helpful.
4519,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,"No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!"
4520,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Prisoner,No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
4521,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
4522,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Woman,"Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread."
4523,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,Polliver. The Mountain.
4524,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
4525,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
4526,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,Can that truly be you?
4527,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,Who else might it be?
4528,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
4529,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,My own.
4530,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"
4531,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
4532,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."
4533,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,"Watch yourself, Renly."
4534,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."
4535,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke."
4536,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
4537,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,That's twice I've warned you.
4538,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,"Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
4539,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
4540,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Catelyn Stark,We share a common enemy.
4541,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
4542,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
4543,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
4544,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,"Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
4545,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
4546,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
4547,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,"We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
4548,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."
4549,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Renly,Would you believe I loved him once?
4550,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,I thought we were welcome.
4551,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Jorah Mormont,"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
4552,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,Horde?
4553,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,My name is Daenerys-
4554,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
4555,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,"You know me, my lord?"
4556,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
4557,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,And what should I call you?
4558,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
4559,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
4560,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice,KING Qarth.
4561,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,Qarth.
4562,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,Might we see the dragons?
4563,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
4564,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
4565,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,I am not a liar.
4566,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
4567,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
4568,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
4569,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
4570,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
4571,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,"If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
4572,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
4573,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Jorah Mormont,"Khaleesi, please be careful."
4574,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
4575,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-"
4576,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Xaro,Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
4577,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,"The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
4578,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Xaro,"I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
4579,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
4580,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Xaro,"Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
4581,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,Our decision is final.
4582,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Xaro,Very well. I invoke soumai.
4583,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Xaro,"I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
4584,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Spice King,Be it on your head.
4585,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Xaro,"Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
4586,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tickler,Is there gold or silver in the village?
4587,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Gendry Baratheon,I'm not from the village.
4588,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Gendry Baratheon,I don't know what that is.
4589,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Man,You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
4590,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tywin Lannister,What's this?
4591,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Mountain,"We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
4592,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tywin Lannister,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
4593,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Mountain,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
4594,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Polliver,"This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
4595,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tywin Lannister,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
4596,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tywin Lannister,"You, do you have a trade?"
4597,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Gendry Baratheon,"Smith, my lord."
4598,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Polliver,"What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
4599,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tywin Lannister,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
4600,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Arya Stark,"Safer to travel, my lord."
4601,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tywin Lannister,Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
4602,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Mountain,My lord.
4603,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
4604,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
4605,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
4606,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
4607,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
4608,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
4609,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
4610,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,As I said several times.
4611,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
4612,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
4613,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
4614,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
4615,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
4616,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
4617,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,I am a knight!
4618,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
4619,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
4620,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
4621,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,It's not my fault!
4622,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
4623,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
4624,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
4625,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,I only meant I did as I was bid.
4626,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
4627,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
4628,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
4629,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
4630,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"No, I think not."
4631,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,My lord?
4632,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
4633,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,"Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
4634,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
4635,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,But her demands?
4636,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
4637,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Lancel,You will?
4638,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
4639,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,Your Grace.
4640,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
4641,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
4642,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,Fewer.
4643,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,Pardon?
4644,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
4645,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
4646,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,"You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
4647,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
4648,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,Does he listen?
4649,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
4650,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
4651,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,I've lived within the law for seventeen-
4652,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
4653,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
4654,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
4655,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,"I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
4656,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Stannis Baratheon,Cleaner ways don't win wars.
4657,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
4658,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
4659,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
4660,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
4661,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
4662,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,And which are you?
4663,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
4664,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,"Well, that must be very nice for you."
4665,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,Do you love your wife?
4666,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,I do.
4667,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,Yet you have known other women.
4668,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,Don't talk about my wife.
4669,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
4670,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,And you will.
4671,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
4672,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
4673,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
4674,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,They can't bar our passage.
4675,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Davos,Gods protect us.
4676,2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,Melisandre,"There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
4677,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,You swear it?
4678,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
4679,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,"Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
4680,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,And the wording of this oath?
4681,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
4682,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,And in return for my son's loyalty?
4683,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
4684,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
4685,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
4686,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
4687,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Renly,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
4688,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,No! No.
4689,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Soldier,Follow me!
4690,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Soldier,You'll die for this.
4691,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,"No, wait, it wasn't her!"
4692,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
4693,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,Inside the king's tent - go
4694,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,Now.
4695,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,I won't leave him.
4696,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
4697,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,"Over there, go!"
4698,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,Not that way.
4699,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,We need to go home. Loras.
4700,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,"My lord, my lady."
4701,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,Get out.
4702,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
4703,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,And you want that privilege for yourself.
4704,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
4705,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,There's no time for this.
4706,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
4707,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
4708,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
4709,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,Stannis.
4710,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
4711,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,You can't stay here.
4712,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,"He would have been a true king, a good king."
4713,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
4714,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Loras,Revenge.
4715,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
4716,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
4717,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,He was very handsome.
4718,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,"He was, Your Grace."
4719,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,"Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
4720,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Petyr Baelish,Do you want to be a queen?
4721,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Margaery Tyrell,No. I want to be the queen.
4722,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,Killed? By whom?
4723,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
4724,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,Really? Who'd have thought?
4725,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
4726,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
4727,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
4728,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
4729,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
4730,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
4731,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,She'll be safer in Dorne.
4732,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
4733,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
4734,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
4735,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
4736,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
4737,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
4738,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
4739,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,It's important that we talk about this.
4740,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Cersei Lannister,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
4741,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,It's wildfire.
4742,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
4743,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,No.
4744,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,MThat's a lie right there.
4745,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
4746,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
4747,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,I'm telling you the truth.
4748,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,The smart money would be on more likely.
4749,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,She's making wildfire.
4750,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
4751,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
4752,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
4753,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
4754,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,When did she tell you this?
4755,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
4756,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,Swear to me on what?
4757,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,On my life.
4758,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,But I don't care about your life.
4759,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
4760,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
4761,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
4762,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Lancel,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
4763,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,It will be my pleasure.
4764,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,Your Grace.
4765,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,What is it?
4766,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
4767,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
4768,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
4769,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
4770,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,"Your Grace, I-"
4771,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
4772,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
4773,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,You've come to lecture me on truth?
4774,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,I've come to tell you that what I saw.
4775,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
4776,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
4777,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,I'll hear no more about it.
4778,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,"Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
4779,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,When do we sail for King's Landing?
4780,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
4781,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
4782,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,That's not your concern.
4783,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
4784,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
4785,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
4786,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
4787,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
4788,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,What do you believe?
4789,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
4790,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
4791,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Davos,"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
4792,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Stannis Baratheon,"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
4793,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Girl,I've got it! I've got it!
4794,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,"So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
4795,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,"Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
4796,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
4797,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
4798,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
4799,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
4800,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
4801,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Protester,Corruption.
4802,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Crowd,Yes!
4803,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Protester,"We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
4804,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
4805,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
4806,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
4807,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
4808,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,You have to admire his imagination.
4809,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,He's talking about you.
4810,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,What? Demon monkey?
4811,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
4812,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
4813,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,You don't need to convince me.
4814,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,Demon monkey.
4815,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,"Yeah, come on."
4816,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
4817,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
4818,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Black Lorren,"Where are we headed, Captain?"
4819,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
4820,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Black Lorren,And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
4821,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,I do. Your captain.
4822,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Black Lorren,"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
4823,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
4824,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Yara Greyjoy,Stop. We yield.
4825,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Yara Greyjoy,Congratulations on your first command.
4826,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
4827,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Yara Greyjoy,"Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
4828,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
4829,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Yara Greyjoy,"That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
4830,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dagmer,"Come on, I'll take you out."
4831,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,Who are you?
4832,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dagmer,"Dagmer, your first mate."
4833,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
4834,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dagmer,They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
4835,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
4836,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dagmer,You're not.
4837,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
4838,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dagmer,They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
4839,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
4840,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dagmer,"The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
4841,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
4842,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Theon Greyjoy,Take me to my ship.
4843,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Reginald,"The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
4844,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
4845,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Amory,Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
4846,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
4847,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Reginald,"We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
4848,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
4849,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Reginald,My wife's in Lannisport.
4850,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
4851,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
4852,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
4853,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,"Maidenpool, my lord."
4854,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
4855,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,"House Mooton, my lord."
4856,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,And what is their sigil?
4857,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
4858,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
4859,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
4860,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
4861,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,They call him the Young Wolf.
4862,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,And?
4863,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
4864,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,And do you believe them?
4865,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
4866,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tywin Lannister,Fetch that water.
4867,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,A girl says nothing.
4868,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,"A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
4869,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,I was always a girl.
4870,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
4871,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
4872,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
4873,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,I didn't have a choice.
4874,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,You did. I did. And here we are.
4875,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
4876,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,Three what?
4877,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
4878,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
4879,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,A man has said.
4880,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,The one who tortures everyone.
4881,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,A man needs a name.
4882,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
4883,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jaqen Hghar,"That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
4884,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
4885,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,When will he come?
4886,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
4887,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,My uncle told me stories about him.
4888,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,Most of them are true.
4889,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
4890,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
4891,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
4892,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
4893,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
4894,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dolorous Edd,There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
4895,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Man,About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
4896,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
4897,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dolorous Edd,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
4898,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
4899,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dolorous Edd,Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
4900,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
4901,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Grenn,Wildlings?
4902,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
4903,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dolorous Edd,"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
4904,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
4905,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Grenn,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
4906,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,Well I read it in a book.
4907,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dolorous Edd,I read it in a book.
4908,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
4909,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Dolorous,"EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah."
4910,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,"Take care, my lord."
4911,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
4912,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,"Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
4913,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,"After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
4914,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,My companion takes issue.
4915,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
4916,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
4917,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,To do what?
4918,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
4919,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,How much do you have?
4920,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
4921,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,"My lord, this man is insulting."
4922,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
4923,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,My friend remains unconvinced.
4924,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
4925,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
4926,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Haylene,"We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
4927,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bronn,This is a shit idea.
4928,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
4929,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys. Dracarys.
4930,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
4931,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
4932,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Doreah,"Yes, Khaleesi."
4933,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,He loves you.
4934,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Irri,I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
4935,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you, my friend."
4936,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Doreah,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
4937,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Irri,It is known.
4938,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Doreah,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
4939,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
4940,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Irri,May he ride forever through the night lands.
4941,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
4942,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Doreah,You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
4943,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Irri,"She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
4944,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Irri,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
4945,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Woman,And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
4946,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,It sounds wonderful.
4947,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Woman,The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
4948,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Please excuse me for a moment.
4949,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,What are they doing?
4950,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
4951,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Kovarro,Or melt it. Very simple.
4952,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
4953,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Kovarro,"Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
4954,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Not even when we leave.
4955,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Kovarro,Why not?
4956,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
4957,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
4958,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
4959,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
4960,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Pyatt Pree,"Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
4961,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Pyatt Pree,Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
4962,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Pyatt Pree,"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
4963,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
4964,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,What is the House of the Undying?
4965,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
4966,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Quaithe,You watch over her.
4967,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,Do I know you?
4968,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Quaithe,I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
4969,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,Who are you?
4970,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Quaithe,"I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
4971,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,It looked like Stannis.
4972,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
4973,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,In the shape of Stannis.
4974,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
4975,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,"Will you stay there long, my lady?"
4976,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,"Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
4977,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,I never knew my mother.
4978,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,I'm sorry.
4979,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
4980,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,It's a bloody business.
4981,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,What comes after is even harder.
4982,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
4983,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,You mean to kill Stannis.
4984,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,I swore a vow.
4985,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
4986,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
4987,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
4988,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,I only held him that once as he was dying.
4989,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,"He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
4990,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,"I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
4991,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
4992,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Brienne,"Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
4993,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Catelyn Stark,I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
4994,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Winterfell Shepherd,"And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
4995,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
4996,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Winterfell Shepherd,"My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
4997,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,"Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
4998,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Luwin,Good.
4999,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,Hodor.
5000,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Hodor,Hodor.
5001,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Rodrik,Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.
5002,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Luwin,Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
5003,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Rodrik,Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
5004,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,We have to help them.
5005,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Rodrik,"Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men."
5006,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Luwin,Do you need so many?
5007,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,"If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need."
5008,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Rodrik,"Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here."
5009,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,"So, what does it mean?"
5010,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.
5011,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
5012,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,"Must not mean anything, then."
5013,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,You're lying.
5014,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,"You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar."
5015,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,You know what it means.
5016,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,I never said I didn't.
5017,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,You didn't give me an honest answer.
5018,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,That's not the same as being a liar.
5019,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,"Well, it's not far off."
5020,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,"So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?"
5021,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,"Something bad? Tell me, boy."
5022,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,"I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them."
5023,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,The sea is hundreds of miles away.
5024,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,I know. It's just a stupid dream.
5025,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
5026,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Bran Stark,"Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?"
5027,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Osha,They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
5028,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,There.
5029,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,Where?
5030,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,On that mountain.
5031,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,I don't see very well.
5032,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,A fire.
5033,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,"There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor."
5034,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,How many wildlings have joined him?
5035,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move."
5036,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,Where?
5037,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
5038,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
5039,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,"Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"
5040,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,We need to get rid of those lookouts.
5041,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,"It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba."
5042,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
5043,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger."
5044,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jon Snow,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
5045,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,He's the one?
5046,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
5047,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Qhorin,"Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat."
5048,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Sam,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
5049,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jeor,"Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on."
5050,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?"
5051,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
5052,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
5053,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,And what about what a woman wants?
5054,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
5055,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
5056,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,Why?
5057,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
5058,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
5059,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
5060,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"Ah, a conqueror."
5061,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
5062,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."
5063,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
5064,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
5065,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,I will show you why.
5066,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.
5067,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,And behind the door?
5068,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,And it can all be mine?
5069,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home."
5070,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,All I have to do?
5071,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,Is marry me.
5072,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,That was a romantic proposal.
5073,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses."
5074,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro,"See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead."
5075,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
5076,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
5077,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
5078,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,The usurper is dead.
5079,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
5080,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
5081,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
5082,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,"Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
5083,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
5084,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
5085,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
5086,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,I only want-
5087,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,What do you want? Tell me.
5088,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,To see you on the Iron Throne.
5089,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,Why?
5090,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
5091,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
5092,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,"Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
5093,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,And how do I get the ship?
5094,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
5095,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Daenerys Targaryen,I look forward to meeting him.
5096,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Jorah Mormont,Khaleesi.
5097,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,You should stand sideface.
5098,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Gendry Baratheon,Sideface?
5099,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,Sideways.
5100,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Gendry Baratheon,Why?
5101,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,Smaller target.
5102,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Gendry Baratheon,Am I fighting someone?
5103,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Arya Stark,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
5104,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Gold Cloak,Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
5105,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Gold Cloak,Go up the battlement.
5106,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Woman,That is strange.
5107,2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Gold Cloak,Move away. Stand back. He's dead.
5108,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I've taken your castle.
5109,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,Theon?
5110,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
5111,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,Why?
5112,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,To take the castle.
5113,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,You went with Robb.
5114,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
5115,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,I don't know.
5116,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,Find the halfwit.
5117,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
5118,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
5119,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,I won't.
5120,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes, you will."
5121,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
5122,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
5123,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
5124,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
5125,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
5126,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
5127,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Farlen,"Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit."
5128,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,"Farlen, you be silent."
5129,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
5130,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,All of you should do as he commands.
5131,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
5132,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Farlen,Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-
5133,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ironborn,Shut up!
5134,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
5135,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Luwin,I am.
5136,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
5137,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Luwin,My lord.
5138,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,My Lord Greyjoy.
5139,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
5140,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,You were here the day I was taken.
5141,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
5142,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,Let me serve you.
5143,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
5144,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
5145,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
5146,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,Step aside.
5147,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,"It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me."
5148,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
5149,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Black Lorren,Greyjoy!
5150,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Black Lorren,We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
5151,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
5152,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
5153,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,They are not my people.
5154,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,King Robb thought of you as a brother.
5155,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
5156,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,"Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons."
5157,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
5158,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,If he were alive to see this
5159,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
5160,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
5161,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
5162,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,Take him to the cells. Lock him up
5163,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Dagmer,My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
5164,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
5165,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Dagmer,"No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives."
5166,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
5167,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
5168,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
5169,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Luwin,I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
5170,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
5171,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Luwin,"He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do."
5172,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
5173,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Dagmer,Come.
5174,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!
5175,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
5176,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,I'm begging you.
5177,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,Coward.
5178,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
5179,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
5180,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,"Please, stop this. Please stop him."
5181,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,"Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father."
5182,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,"You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please."
5183,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Any last words, old man?"
5184,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik,"Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost."
5185,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,"Theon, please don't."
5186,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Rickon,Do something!
5187,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Bran Stark,"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!"
5188,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
5189,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,There goes your pet.
5190,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,He's not a pet.
5191,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing."
5192,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,Ghost is different.
5193,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night."
5194,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
5195,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
5196,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,We could do the same.
5197,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
5198,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,My father always said I'm of the North.
5199,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I wasn't joking.
5200,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
5201,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
5202,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I'll gladly give my life.
5203,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
5204,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I do.
5205,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
5206,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Can you read?
5207,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,My lord?
5208,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
5209,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,"My apologies, my lord. I must have-"
5210,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
5211,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,My cupbearer can read better than you.
5212,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
5213,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Armory,"My lord, I-"
5214,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
5215,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
5216,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Lord Petyr Baelish.
5217,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Mmm. Give us the room.
5218,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Clear all this.
5219,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,Lord Tywin.
5220,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Baelish.
5221,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Wine?
5222,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,Thank you.
5223,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,What news from the capital?
5224,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
5225,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
5226,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
5227,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
5228,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
5229,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
5230,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
5231,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, yes, yes."
5232,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
5233,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Wants to be queen.
5234,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,"Yes, she does."
5235,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
5236,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
5237,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,More wine for Lord Baelish.
5238,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
5239,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,They have.
5240,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,"Pardon, my lord."
5241,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,It's only wine.
5242,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,You would ride there yourself?
5243,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,"Tonight, with your leave."
5244,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
5245,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,And what else?
5246,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
5247,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Why?
5248,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Petyr Baelish,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
5249,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Hmm.
5250,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,A girl.
5251,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,A wildling.
5252,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,We could question her.
5253,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
5254,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,What's your name?
5255,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Ygritte.
5256,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
5257,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,I gave you my name.
5258,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I'm Jon Snow.
5259,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,You ought to burn them you killed.
5260,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?"
5261,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
5262,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
5263,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,The Free Folk.
5264,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,How many?
5265,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
5266,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
5267,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,Do you mean to march on the Wall?
5268,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"Do you know who I am, girl?"
5269,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Qhorin Halfhand.
5270,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?"
5271,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
5272,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
5273,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,"No. No, I'll do it."
5274,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Qhorin,"Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now."
5275,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us."
5276,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I'm as much a crow as they are.
5277,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Will you burn me? After?
5278,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
5279,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold."
5280,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Go on. Be quick about it.
5281,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"Do it. Bastard, do it!"
5282,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,You can't do it. We both know it.
5283,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."
5284,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,I'll find them.
5285,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.
5286,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Septon,May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.
5287,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Cersei Lannister,"One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you."
5288,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.
5289,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,I saw you cry.
5290,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,"Did you say something, my lady?"
5291,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
5292,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,So?
5293,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,It seems a normal thing.
5294,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,Is your little brother a prince?
5295,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,No.
5296,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,"Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog."
5297,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,"Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace."
5298,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Murderer! Bastard!
5299,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,All hail the King.
5300,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,He's no king.
5301,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,He's a bastard!
5302,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,"Please, Your Grace, we're hungry."
5303,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Freak.
5304,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
5305,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,"Yes, my lord. Come, quickly."
5306,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Woman,"Please, Your Grace, give us some food!"
5307,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,"Bread, Your Grace, please!"
5308,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!
5309,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Hold on!
5310,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Hold them back!
5311,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,Just kill them! Kill them all!
5312,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,Move. Move!
5313,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Pull back!
5314,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Tear him to pieces!
5315,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,What are you doing? I want these people executed!
5316,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sandor Clegane,And they want the same for you.
5317,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,Where's Sansa?
5318,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Through the door.
5319,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Come on.
5320,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Push hard.
5321,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Meryn,Protect the king!
5322,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Get back!
5323,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Fall back! Keep him safe!
5324,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Come in! Come in!
5325,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Cuard,Keep him safe!
5326,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Crowd,Motherfucker! Brotherfucker!
5327,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,Watch out. Hold them back.
5328,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Hey.
5329,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,Traitors! I'll have all their heads.
5330,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, you blind, bloody fool!"
5331,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,You can't insult me.
5332,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
5333,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,You can't-
5334,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"I can, I am."
5335,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,They attacked me!
5336,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
5337,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,You're talking to a king!
5338,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
5339,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Joffrey Lannister,Let them have her!
5340,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
5341,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Where are you going?
5342,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,"You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here."
5343,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
5344,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Meryn,I take my orders from the king.
5345,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Where? This way.
5346,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,Please! No! No!
5347,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,Please!
5348,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sandor Clegane,"You're all right now, little bird. You're all right."
5349,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,We'll get you.
5350,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Man,This way.
5351,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
5352,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sandor Clegane,The little birdo s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.
5353,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tyrion Lannister,"Well done, Clegane."
5354,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sandor Clegane,I didn't do it for you.
5355,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,He shouldn't make me wait.
5356,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth."
5357,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,I already have a husband.
5358,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful."
5359,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
5360,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery."
5361,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,The Mother of Dragons!
5362,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"Ah, here he comes."
5363,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
5364,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
5365,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
5366,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
5367,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
5368,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
5369,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
5370,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
5371,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
5372,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
5373,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
5374,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,"My father sat there, before he was murdered."
5375,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
5376,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,I didn't come here to argue grammar.
5377,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
5378,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,Not yet.
5379,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
5380,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,There are many there that support my claim.
5381,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,When were you there last?
5382,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,I left when I was a baby.
5383,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"So, in truth, you have no allies."
5384,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
5385,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."
5386,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,"Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
5387,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,A shrewd man.
5388,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,"For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
5389,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
5390,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
5391,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,"I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."
5392,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Spice King,"Yes, my lady, but not with my ships."
5393,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Who taught you to read?
5394,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,"My father, my lord."
5395,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
5396,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,A stonemason.
5397,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
5398,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,He taught himself.
5399,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Quite a man. What killed him?
5400,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,Loyalty.
5401,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
5402,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,"Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
5403,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,No. But you've already begun.
5404,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,"Did you know your father, my lord?"
5405,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
5406,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,"He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
5407,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."
5408,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Mmm.
5409,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,"Where are you going, girl?"
5410,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,"The armory, my lord."
5411,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,Why?
5412,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,Lord Tywin sent me.
5413,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,What might this be?
5414,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,Lord Tywin gave it to me.
5415,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,What for?
5416,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,To take to the armory.
5417,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
5418,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Amory,Move! Get out of the way!
5419,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,Amory Lorch.
5420,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jaqen Hghar,A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.
5421,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,Now!
5422,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jaqen Hghar,A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
5423,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Arya Stark,But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
5424,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Tywin Lannister,Guard!
5425,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Soldier,Your Grace.
5426,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Soldier,"My honor, Your Grace."
5427,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Quent,Your Grace.
5428,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,Quent.
5429,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,Lady Talisa.
5430,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
5431,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
5432,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
5433,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,Because it's obvious.
5434,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,"What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?"
5435,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,I'd call you a liar.
5436,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
5437,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
5438,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"Better at amputations, I'm afraid."
5439,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,Quite a pretty spot.
5440,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,Will we be here long?
5441,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
5442,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,I'm not a spy.
5443,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"Of course, a spy would deny being a spy."
5444,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,"You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. ""The Young Wolf is on the move. """
5445,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-"
5446,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,Robb.
5447,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful."
5448,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,Lady Talisa.
5449,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,Lady Stark.
5450,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,Lady Talisa...?
5451,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,Maegyr.
5452,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,"Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name."
5453,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Talisa,"An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace."
5454,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,I've missed you.
5455,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,"Yes, you look positively forlorn."
5456,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today."
5457,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
5458,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,I know.
5459,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
5460,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,A debt that must be paid.
5461,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,I haven't forgotten.
5462,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose Bolton,Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
5463,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
5464,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
5465,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Here? There's no shelter here.
5466,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,There's no shelter anywhere.
5467,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-
5468,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,No fire.
5469,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,But a fire is-
5470,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Have it your way.
5471,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
5472,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
5473,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Think they're out looking for you?
5474,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,Yes.
5475,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Think they'll find you?
5476,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,"You're brave. Stupid, but brave."
5477,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
5478,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,Stop moving.
5479,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,I'm just trying to get comfortable.
5480,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,Stop it!
5481,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Jon Snow,You're still moving.
5482,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte,Was I? I didn't notice that time.
5483,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,This cannot be true.
5484,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose,"We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true."
5485,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,Why? Why would Theon-
5486,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose,Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
5487,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,My brothers?
5488,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose,We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
5489,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
5490,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,I must go north at once.
5491,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose,"There's still a war to win, Your Grace."
5492,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
5493,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose,You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
5494,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Catelyn Stark,Let me go and talk to Theon.
5495,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
5496,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Roose,"Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."
5497,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Robb Stark,"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
5498,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
5499,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,I'm no liar.
5500,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
5501,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,"I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord."
5502,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
5503,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,"There are other ways to serve, my lord."
5504,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
5505,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ahsa,"There are other ways to serve, my prince."
5506,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,Like what?
5507,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,"We know things, the free people."
5508,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
5509,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,Other things.
5510,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,Savage things.
5511,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,Wait outside.
5512,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I always wondered what you had under there.
5513,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,It comes at a price.
5514,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
5515,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,I already had that.
5516,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
5517,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Ahsa,What all free people want. My freedom.
5518,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Theon Greyjoy,"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
5519,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,Ow!
5520,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Shae,Shh. It's not deep.
5521,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,I thought they were going to kill me.
5522,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Shae,"They thought so, too."
5523,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,"He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
5524,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Shae,Of course he did.
5525,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,Why? Why would a stranger-
5526,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Shae,You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
5527,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
5528,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Shae,Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-
5529,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Sansa Stark,But you're not the wrong people.
5530,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Shae,Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
5531,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,And where are you going?
5532,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,I have something for you from Prince Theon.
5533,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Guard,What?
5534,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Osha,Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
5535,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
5536,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets."
5537,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro,"Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi."
5538,2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,Daenerys Targaryen,Where are they? Where are my dragons?
5539,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
5540,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Black Lorren,The giant must have took him.
5541,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
5542,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Black Lorren,"Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking."
5543,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,Right. Get the horses and the hounds.
5544,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,"Come on, find the scent. Where they going?"
5545,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Dagmer,Halt!
5546,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,Enjoying your first hunt?
5547,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,"So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord."
5548,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"With hunting, there's blood at the end."
5549,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,They're little boys.
5550,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
5551,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
5552,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,They have no value to me missing.
5553,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
5554,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
5555,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,We have a scent!
5556,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
5557,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,We should have took more food.
5558,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Bran Stark,We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
5559,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
5560,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Bran Stark,"And if Theon found out, he'd hang them."
5561,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,The boy can't survive on walnuts.
5562,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickon,I'm fine.
5563,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.
5564,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Hodor,Hodor.
5565,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,"Even you, sweet giant."
5566,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Bran Stark,"Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there."
5567,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickon,Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
5568,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Bran Stark,"We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are."
5569,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rikon,Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
5570,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,"You've never seen me climb a tree, little man."
5571,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Bran Stark,They'll be after us with hounds.
5572,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Osha,"We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever."
5573,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
5574,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
5575,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Let's move.
5576,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?"
5577,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
5578,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-
5579,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Don't call them that.
5580,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"What, stones? Or bone?"
5581,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Neither. Both.
5582,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Move!
5583,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?"
5584,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
5585,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,So the lads just do it with each other?
5586,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,No.
5587,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,Never?
5588,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Never. We swore an oath.
5589,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable."
5590,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Would you please shut up?
5591,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman."
5592,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,You're a free woman?
5593,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman."
5594,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
5595,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
5596,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,It was my choice to say the words.
5597,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,So you don't like girls?
5598,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Of course I like girls.
5599,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,But you chose never to touch them.
5600,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
5601,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-"
5602,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
5603,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
5604,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
5605,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,So why are you fighting us?
5606,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,"Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up."
5607,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
5608,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Mountian,We hanged twenty men last night.
5609,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
5610,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Mountain,We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
5611,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
5612,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Mountain,"Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."
5613,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
5614,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Mmm. Is that mutton?
5615,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,"Yes, my lord."
5616,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Don't like mutton.
5617,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,I'll bring something else.
5618,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Leave it. Are you hungry?
5619,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,No.
5620,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Of course you are. Eat.
5621,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
5622,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
5623,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
5624,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
5625,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
5626,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Have you ever lost before?
5627,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
5628,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
5629,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
5630,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
5631,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Dragons?
5632,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Yes. Dragons happened.
5633,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
5634,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Aegon and his sisters.
5635,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Mmm?
5636,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
5637,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
5638,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
5639,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
5640,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
5641,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
5642,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
5643,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Most girls are idiots.
5644,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
5645,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,From my father.
5646,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
5647,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
5648,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
5649,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"And, girl."
5650,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,M'lord.
5651,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
5652,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,"My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
5653,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
5654,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Arya Stark,Yes.
5655,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin Lannister,Go on.
5656,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,"I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
5657,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sandor Clegane,Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
5658,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,Does it give you joy to scare people?
5659,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sandor Clegane,"No, it gives me joy to kill people."
5660,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sandor Clegane,Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
5661,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,It was his duty. He never liked it.
5662,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sandor Clegane,Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
5663,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,Why are you always so hateful?
5664,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sandor Clegane,You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
5665,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
5666,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,You are one of the Thirteen.
5667,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,"If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own."
5668,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
5669,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
5670,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
5671,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,"I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof."
5672,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,But it did happen under your roof.
5673,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,"Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-"
5674,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't care where you've been.
5675,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."
5676,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
5677,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night."
5678,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
5679,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Walk.
5680,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,I could teach you how to do it.
5681,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,I know how to do it.
5682,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
5683,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,And what did she say?
5684,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"She admired your spirit, Your Grace."
5685,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,And what then?
5686,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"She, uh..."
5687,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,"If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang."
5688,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"She tore the paper in half, Your Grace."
5689,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,"You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
5690,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,"Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork."
5691,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Roose,Too many prisoners.
5692,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,Is there room for Ser Alton?
5693,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,Does he need to lie down?
5694,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
5695,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,Torrhen.
5696,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,That will be all.
5697,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,Your Grace. A minute of your time?
5698,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,I've been treating your wounded men.
5699,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,"And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
5700,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,They're not my enemies.
5701,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,That's what I tell my bannermen.
5702,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,"I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses."
5703,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,But some are not.
5704,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,I need silk for stitching.
5705,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,"I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over."
5706,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,If you need help finding these-
5707,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,"I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you."
5708,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,"Continue, my lady."
5709,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
5710,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,Yes.
5711,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
5712,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,I expect he will.
5713,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,If I could write a list-
5714,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,Come with me to the Crag.
5715,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Talisa,I don't think that will be-
5716,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,"Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men."
5717,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Woman,"Children, come inside, quick. Come on."
5718,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Child,Hurry up!
5719,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,"Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent."
5720,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,Try again.
5721,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
5722,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,"We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord."
5723,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."
5724,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Prince Theon.
5725,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,Where are they?
5726,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Winterfell Shepherd,"Who, m'lord?"
5727,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,The Stark boys. Where are they?
5728,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Winterfell Shepherd,I don't know. I seen no one.
5729,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,Think harder.
5730,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Winterfell Shepherd,"I swear, m'lord. I don't know."
5731,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Dagmer,"My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for."
5732,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Dagmer,Send the old man home.
5733,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
5734,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,"Theon, don't do this."
5735,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,You came back.
5736,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
5737,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,Irri is dead.
5738,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,I know. She was a good-
5739,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
5740,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,Doreah?
5741,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
5742,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,I should have been here.
5743,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,You went to find me a ship.
5744,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
5745,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"These people""?"
5746,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,They are not to be trusted.
5747,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
5748,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,Your people are in Westeros.
5749,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
5750,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,They will soon enough.
5751,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
5752,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,"You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
5753,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it."
5754,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,You are too young to be so-
5755,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,And you are too familiar.
5756,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how."
5757,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,Find my dragons.
5758,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,How long till we get back to your crows?
5759,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,We're close.
5760,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?"
5761,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
5762,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Nothing happened between you and me.
5763,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?"
5764,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Turn back around.
5765,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'"" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-"
5766,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,"What, right here in the muck?"
5767,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,I'll keep you warm enough.
5768,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,Are you that afraid of it?
5769,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,That's enough.
5770,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,It's nice and wet and warm.
5771,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jon Snow,Enough!
5772,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,It don't have teeth.
5773,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,"All right! All right. Gods, you're dull."
5774,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte,Should have took me while you had the chance.
5775,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,"No, no!"
5776,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,"No. Oh, no."
5777,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Shae,It's all right. Give me that.
5778,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,"If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
5779,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Shae,Help me flip it over.
5780,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Shae,Where are you going?
5781,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Handmaiden,To tell Her Grace.
5782,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Shae,You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
5783,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
5784,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
5785,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,In what way?
5786,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,I thought it would be less messy.
5787,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,Wait until you birth a child.
5788,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
5789,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
5790,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
5791,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
5792,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,His Grace was not with you?
5793,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
5794,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"You may never love the king, but you will love his children."
5795,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,I love His Grace with all my heart.
5796,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
5797,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Sansa Stark,"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
5798,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"You can try, little dove."
5799,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,Who did you say your mother was again?
5800,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,Cinda Lannister.
5801,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,Is she the fat one?
5802,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-"
5803,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
5804,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"I squired for you once, you know."
5805,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,When?
5806,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding."
5807,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
5808,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
5809,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
5810,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,Bryan.
5811,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
5812,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"That's right. I ran up and volunteered. ""Let me, my lord. Let me."" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family."
5813,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"You didn't, though."
5814,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,You really remember?
5815,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
5816,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,When I think back to that day-
5817,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Guard,Shh!
5818,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,You were saying?
5819,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.
5820,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
5821,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
5822,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,I understand completely.
5823,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
5824,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
5825,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,Which knight was it?
5826,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
5827,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,What was he like?
5828,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
5829,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,It's hard to put into words.
5830,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
5831,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
5832,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,Did you squire for him again?
5833,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
5834,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
5835,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,And have you thought about
5836,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,Of course. Every day.
5837,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,And?
5838,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
5839,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
5840,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,What is it?
5841,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,It's actually quite simple.
5842,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,"Well, let me help you."
5843,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,You'll only have to do one thing.
5844,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Alton,Tell me.
5845,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,You'll have to die.
5846,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
5847,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,I didn't come here for lessons.
5848,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,"No, you came for the dragons."
5849,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,You have them? Where are they?
5850,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
5851,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,You love her.
5852,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,Where are the dragons?
5853,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,"Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?"
5854,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,Will you betray her again?
5855,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jorah Mormont,Never.
5856,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Quaith,The thief you seek is with her now.
5857,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Spice King,I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
5858,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
5859,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
5860,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Silk King,Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
5861,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,"Without me, the dragons will die."
5862,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Spice King,"It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you."
5863,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Pyat Pree,"You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi."
5864,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,How?
5865,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Pyatt Pree,I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
5866,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,You have my dragons?
5867,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Pyat Pree,"When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me."
5868,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Daenerys Targaryen,But there is no King of Qarth.
5869,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
5870,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,"You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me."
5871,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Spice King,"Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king."
5872,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Xaro,"An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
5873,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Pyat Pree,"The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."
5874,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Pyattpree,A mother should be with her children.
5875,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Pyat Pree,"Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them."
5876,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jacks,Lady Stark!
5877,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Brienne,No farther.
5878,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jacks,"Keep your hands off me, woman."
5879,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Brienne,"Don't enter without an invitation, man."
5880,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jacks,Forgive me. Lady Stark.
5881,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,What is it?
5882,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jacks,They caught the Kingslayer.
5883,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Kingslayer!
5884,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
5885,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Hang him!
5886,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,You'll die today.
5887,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Justice for the Karstark.
5888,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Gut him!
5889,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
5890,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,"Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner."
5891,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard,This monster killed my son.
5892,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,"And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
5893,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
5894,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,"You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!"
5895,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,And where is our king now?
5896,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Robb Stark,You know very well.
5897,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,"He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him."
5898,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,How dare you!
5899,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Brienne,Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
5900,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
5901,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
5902,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,"When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."
5903,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,Wise men do not make demands of kings.
5904,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Rickard Karstark,Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
5905,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
5906,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
5907,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
5908,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,And gag him!
5909,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,Since when do you light your own candles?
5910,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
5911,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
5912,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
5913,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,More than we have.
5914,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
5915,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
5916,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
5917,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
5918,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
5919,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
5920,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
5921,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
5922,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,I thought the girls might help him.
5923,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,Did you?
5924,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,I was wrong. If we can't control him
5925,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
5926,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
5927,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
5928,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
5929,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
5930,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,Sins?
5931,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Cersei Lannister,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
5932,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Tyrion Lannister,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
5933,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,Then why wait?
5934,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,We're sworn to the king.
5935,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,There's not a king.
5936,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,That's treason.
5937,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,"So is saving Lannisters, yeah?"
5938,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,"Back off, you."
5939,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Man,"No, I won't."
5940,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Brienne,"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?"
5941,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,So they say.
5942,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Brienne,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
5943,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,Come.
5944,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,I need to be alone with him.
5945,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Guard,"My lady, our orders-"
5946,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
5947,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
5948,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
5949,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
5950,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,You strangled his son with your chains.
5951,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
5952,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
5953,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
5954,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
5955,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
5956,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,You are a man without honor.
5957,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
5958,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,Brienne.
5959,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Jaime Lannister,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
5960,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Catelyn Stark,Your sword.
5961,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
5962,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,What are you doing? What have you done?
5963,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Theon Greyjoy,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
5964,2012-05-13,Season 2,Episode 7,A Man Without Honor,Luwin,No!
5965,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,Riders approaching!
5966,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Mar,Open the gate!
5967,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell."
5968,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Envy isn't attractive.
5969,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,What envy?
5970,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
5971,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
5972,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
5973,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,You treated them with honor? By butchering them?
5974,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
5975,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need."
5976,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Exactly.
5977,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.
5978,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,They made me a promise
5979,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
5980,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Don't call me
5981,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?
5982,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
5983,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,You are weak. And you're stupid.
5984,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,I'm warning you.
5985,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"Go on, then. Warn me."
5986,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
5987,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
5988,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
5989,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-"
5990,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
5991,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Leave us.
5992,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone."
5993,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,I don't intend to die.
5994,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."
5995,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,"I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones."
5996,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Lord Of Bones,I already got one crow. Don't need two.
5997,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
5998,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Lord Of Bones,The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.
5999,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,He could have killed me half a dozen times.
6000,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Lord Of Bones,And now he wishes he did. Gut him.
6001,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,"He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son."
6002,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,Mance will want him.
6003,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Lord Of Bones,What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
6004,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.
6005,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Lord Of Bones,"He runs, I'll chop his balls off."
6006,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,"He runs, I'll do it meself."
6007,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ygritte,"We're even now, Jon Snow."
6008,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jon Snow,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
6009,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Qhorin,I know.
6010,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jon Snow,The others?
6011,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Qhorin,"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you."
6012,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jon Snow,They died because of me.
6013,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Qhorin,See that it wasn't for nothing.
6014,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Wildling,"All right, up, lad."
6015,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Wildling,"Come on, on your feet, now. Move it."
6016,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,Is she beautiful?
6017,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,I've never met her.
6018,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,What's her name?
6019,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
6020,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,I'm sure you'll be very happy.
6021,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,And you're marrying her for a bridge?
6022,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,An important bridge.
6023,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,Ah.
6024,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
6025,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."
6026,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
6027,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
6028,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
6029,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,I wish I could have met him.
6030,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,He would have liked you.
6031,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
6032,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
6033,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.
6034,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,Then why don't you?
6035,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
6036,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean."
6037,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,That would be a start.
6038,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Rider,"Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night."
6039,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,How? How?
6040,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Tell me this isn't true.
6041,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Why?
6042,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,For the girls.
6043,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,You betrayed me.
6044,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,Robb-
6045,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
6046,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
6047,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Rickard Karstark,"I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
6048,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
6049,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Rickard Karstark,I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.
6050,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
6051,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
6052,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
6053,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Soldier,"Forty, Your Grace."
6054,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
6055,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Catelyn Stark,Robb.
6056,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,Damn.
6057,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
6058,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
6059,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,Brienne of Tarth.
6060,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
6061,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
6062,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
6063,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
6064,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
6065,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
6066,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
6067,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,You will not provoke me to anger.
6068,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
6069,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,I've never seen you fight.
6070,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
6071,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
6072,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
6073,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
6074,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaime Lannister,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
6075,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Brienne,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
6076,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Kevan,King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
6077,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tywin Lannister,Surrender the Iron Throne?
6078,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Kevan,Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.
6079,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tywin Lannister,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
6080,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Kevan,The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
6081,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tywin Lannister,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
6082,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tywin Lannister,Too close to Casterly Rock.
6083,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Kevan,He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
6084,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tywin Lannister,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
6085,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tywin Lannister,"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
6086,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Guard,You've got some questions to answer.
6087,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,Who killed Ser Amory?
6088,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,I don't know! Please!
6089,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.
6090,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,"I told you, I don't know. Please."
6091,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Rorge,"Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl."
6092,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,Where's Jaqen?
6093,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Rorge,"Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it."
6094,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Guard,"Come on, time to kill some wolves."
6095,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,"You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
6096,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,How would I know?
6097,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
6098,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,You need him?
6099,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,He's helping me.
6100,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,I saw him.
6101,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,Where?
6102,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,Ow!
6103,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
6104,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,On patrol. Let go of my ears.
6105,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,What do you want with him anyway?
6106,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Quorin,"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it."
6107,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jon Snow,They'll never trust me.
6108,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Quorin,They might. If you do what needs to be done.
6109,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jon Snow,What?
6110,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Quorin,How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
6111,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jon Snow,I didn't.
6112,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Quorin,"I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard."
6113,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Lord Of Bones,"He's not yours to kill, crow."
6114,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Do you have to do that here?
6115,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,I like to keep me hands clean.
6116,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
6117,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
6118,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
6119,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
6120,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
6121,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
6122,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
6123,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
6124,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,What?
6125,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,What?
6126,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
6127,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
6128,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
6129,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Stannis will be here any day.
6130,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,And one of these explains how to beat him?
6131,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
6132,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
6133,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
6134,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
6135,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
6136,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,For questioning?
6137,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
6138,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,We talked about this.
6139,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
6140,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
6141,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
6142,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
6143,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
6144,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
6145,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,We could throw books at his men.
6146,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,We don't have that many books.
6147,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Bronn,"We don't have that many men, either."
6148,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,What do we have?
6149,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Pig shit.
6150,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
6151,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dolorous Edd,I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
6152,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
6153,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dolorous Edd,You lack imagination.
6154,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,Where do you think Jon is right now?
6155,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dolorous Edd,He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
6156,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
6157,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,"Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
6158,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
6159,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Eddision,So did his father.
6160,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
6161,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dolorous Edd,Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.
6162,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,What in seven hells is that?
6163,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
6164,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,Look.
6165,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dolorous Edd,"If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
6166,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
6167,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,It's been here a long time.
6168,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
6169,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,Dragonglass?
6170,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sam,The maesters call it obsidian.
6171,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Grenn,Why would a brother hide it here?
6172,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dolorous Edd,I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
6173,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Soldier,Mind where you're going.
6174,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,I'm sorry. I'll-
6175,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,Where were you?
6176,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,A man has patrol duty.
6177,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
6178,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
6179,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
6180,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,"A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
6181,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
6182,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,This a man cannot do.
6183,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,You promised you'd help me.
6184,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,"Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name."
6185,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,And you'll kill them? Anybody?
6186,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,"By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it."
6187,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
6188,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,A girl gives a man his own name?
6189,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,That's right.
6190,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.
6191,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
6192,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,Un-name me.
6193,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,No.
6194,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,Please?
6195,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,I'll un-name you.
6196,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,Thank you.
6197,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,If you help me and my friends escape.
6198,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.
6199,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
6200,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,"A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey."
6201,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,A girl will obey.
6202,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jaqen Hghar,A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
6203,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Thank you, Podrick."
6204,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Odd little boy.
6205,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
6206,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,You and Varys both.
6207,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
6208,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,He's only a boy.
6209,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Younger boys are off fighting his war.
6210,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,He's not ready.
6211,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
6212,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
6213,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
6214,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Do you think I'm an idiot?
6215,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
6216,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
6217,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
6218,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
6219,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
6220,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Because he doesn't have a cock.
6221,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Neither do you.
6222,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
6223,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,It's not that little.
6224,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Why are you smiling?
6225,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Because I'm happy.
6226,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,And why are you happy?
6227,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Because I have your little whore.
6228,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I thought you preferred blondes.
6229,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
6230,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Why do you care who I fuck?
6231,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
6232,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
6233,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
6234,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Where did you find her?
6235,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
6236,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
6237,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
6238,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"You don't buy them, you only rent them."
6239,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
6240,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
6241,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
6242,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
6243,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I promise I will free you.
6244,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Ros,Don't forget me.
6245,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Never.
6246,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
6247,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Get out.
6248,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Shae!
6249,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Shae,I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
6250,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,You're beautiful.
6251,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Shae,Then why do you look sad?
6252,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,We have to be more careful.
6253,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Shae,Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
6254,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,There are people who want to hurt me.
6255,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Shae,I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.
6256,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
6257,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Shae,I'm yours.
6258,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Promise me.
6259,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Shae,I'm yours and you are mine.
6260,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Still no word?
6261,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Roose Bolton,We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle
6262,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
6263,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Roose Bolton,He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
6264,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
6265,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Roose Bolton,"A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-"
6266,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
6267,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Roose Bolton,I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
6268,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace."
6269,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Roose Bolton,My lady.
6270,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,How are you?
6271,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
6272,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
6273,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
6274,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,You have every right. You're a king.
6275,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
6276,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,What kind do you want to be?
6277,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
6278,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."
6279,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
6280,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"No. No, you would not."
6281,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
6282,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,"When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
6283,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Robb Stark,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
6284,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Talisa,I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
6285,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
6286,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,Shut up.
6287,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,"Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven."
6288,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,Shut up. What did you bring?
6289,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Shut up. What did you bring?
6290,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
6291,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,What did he want us to do about those guards?
6292,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
6293,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,What about the guards?
6294,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,He didn't say anything about the guards.
6295,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?"
6296,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,We have to trust him.
6297,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
6298,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Hot Pie,I want to go back to the kitchens.
6299,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Arya Stark,Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
6300,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"Arry, don't."
6301,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,Away! Reset!
6302,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
6303,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,Will it hold?
6304,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
6305,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Man,"Again, pull!"
6306,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
6307,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"I thank you, Your Grace."
6308,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
6309,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
6310,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,Do you? Why?
6311,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,My father was a crabber.
6312,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,And?
6313,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
6314,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
6315,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
6316,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
6317,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,Some are happy to do it to my face.
6318,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
6319,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
6320,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
6321,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,He was only a boy.
6322,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
6323,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
6324,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
6325,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
6326,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,I was relieved they did not.
6327,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
6328,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Davos,"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
6329,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Stannis Baratheon,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
6330,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Joffrey Lannister,You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
6331,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
6332,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Joffrey Lannister,The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
6333,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
6334,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Joffrey Lannister,"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
6335,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
6336,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Joffrey Lannister,They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
6337,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Imagine Stannis' terror.
6338,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,I am trying.
6339,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
6340,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
6341,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
6342,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"I wish we could, too."
6343,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,What do you want? Tell me.
6344,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
6345,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
6346,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,A most highborn plumber.
6347,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
6348,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
6349,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I do. Last thing I expected.
6350,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,And you play it well.
6351,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
6352,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
6353,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
6354,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
6355,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,We should sail there immediately.
6356,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
6357,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
6358,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Varys,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
6359,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"One game at a time, my friend."
6360,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
6361,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Astapor?
6362,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,We cannot stay here.
6363,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
6364,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
6365,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
6366,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
6367,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
6368,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
6369,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
6370,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
6371,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
6372,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,We should bury them.
6373,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dagmer,I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
6374,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
6375,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dagmer,What's this?
6376,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
6377,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dagmer,His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
6378,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dagmer,"His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."
6379,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Osha,Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
6380,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Luwin,You're right so far.
6381,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Osha,Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
6382,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Luwin,Must have been the farmer's boys.
6383,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Osha,He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
6384,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Luwin,They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
6385,2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,Osha,They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.
6386,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,That's it. The tide's against us.
6387,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
6388,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,You're coming home.
6389,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
6390,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,"This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
6391,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
6392,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,"Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
6393,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Gods be good.
6394,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,"God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
6395,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,But not over them?
6396,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,"Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
6397,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
6398,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.
6399,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
6400,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
6401,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"Are you afraid, my lion?"
6402,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
6403,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,I won't let them hurt you.
6404,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
6405,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,It is now.
6406,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,You can't fuck your way out of everything.
6407,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
6408,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Pycelle,"As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
6409,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Your words are always wise and measured.
6410,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Pycelle,"If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King"
6411,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,You brought me something?
6412,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Pycelle,"Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-"
6413,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,I know what ten drops will bring.
6414,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Pycelle,"Your Grace, if I may ask-"
6415,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
6416,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Pycelle,Yes. A siege is very-
6417,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
6418,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Pycelle,Your Grace.
6419,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,"And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-"
6420,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,To the boys!
6421,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
6422,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,Drunk Lannisters.
6423,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Prostitute,You've got a pretty voice.
6424,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,Thank you very much.
6425,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Prostitute,And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
6426,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
6427,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Prostitute,Oh.
6428,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
6429,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
6430,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
6431,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Prostitute,Poor nose.
6432,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
6433,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
6434,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,I don't think he likes me.
6435,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,You think you're a hard man?
6436,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,I know it.
6437,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
6438,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me."
6439,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,Only smaller.
6440,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,And quicker. Eh?
6441,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
6442,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,Aye I expect he will someday.
6443,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Here we are.
6444,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
6445,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
6446,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,A wedding.
6447,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
6448,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
6449,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
6450,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
6451,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,Do you trust him?
6452,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Oddly enough, I do."
6453,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,Good.
6454,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,The map you asked for.
6455,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
6456,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
6457,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
6458,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
6459,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, I'm not."
6460,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
6461,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,What of it?
6462,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
6463,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
6464,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
6465,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
6466,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
6467,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"No, I don't believe you have."
6468,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Varys,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
6469,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,They're welcoming the new king.
6470,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
6471,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,Drums!
6472,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
6473,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,The ships are in the bay.
6474,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,They must be far enough in-
6475,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
6476,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
6477,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
6478,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,Don't get killed.
6479,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Nor you, my friend."
6480,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"Oh, are we friends now?"
6481,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
6482,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,"Enhances it, really."
6483,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
6484,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Bronn,Been spending time with fancy folks.
6485,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
6486,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,Shae.
6487,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
6488,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
6489,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,Sansa.
6490,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
6491,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"Sansa, come here."
6492,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
6493,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Will you?
6494,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Just as I pray for the king's.
6495,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Stay safe, my lady."
6496,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"And you, my lion."
6497,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.
6498,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it."
6499,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
6500,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Will you slay him yourself?
6501,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
6502,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
6503,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
6504,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
6505,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too."
6506,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,Some of those boys will never come back.
6507,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
6508,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"Shh. Come, my lady."
6509,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,Where's our fleet?
6510,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,On the way.
6511,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
6512,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
6513,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,The king has asked you a question.
6514,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
6515,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-
6516,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
6517,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
6518,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Where are their ships?
6519,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
6520,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
6521,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,"If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
6522,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Maybe.
6523,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
6524,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
6525,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,I doubt it.
6526,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,Maybe she's jealous of you.
6527,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Why would she be jealous?
6528,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Sansa.
6529,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
6530,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Yes.
6531,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
6532,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
6533,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,So? I didn't offer you water.
6534,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,What's he doing here?
6535,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
6536,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,But we have guards to defend us.
6537,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
6538,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Gold Cloak,The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
6539,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
6540,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
6541,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,You said he was here to protect us.
6542,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
6543,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,There they are.
6544,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Archers to their marks.
6545,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,"Archers, to your marks!"
6546,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Archers! Nock your arrows!
6547,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Nock arrows!
6548,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Hold fast.
6549,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Hold fast!
6550,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,What are you doing? We need to attack them.
6551,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Boulders ready!
6552,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
6553,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Matthos,There's only one ship.
6554,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
6555,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Nock and set!
6556,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Draw! Hold.
6557,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Hold.
6558,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,There's no one on board.
6559,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,More rocks coming up!
6560,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
6561,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Davos,Matthos! Get down!
6562,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,Prepare to land.
6563,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Your Grace.
6564,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,The dwarf has played his little trick.
6565,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,The wildfire.
6566,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,He can only play it once.
6567,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,"We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die."
6568,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,Thousands.
6569,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,Come with me and take this city!
6570,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
6571,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,My queen.
6572,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,What are you doing?
6573,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Praying.
6574,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
6575,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
6576,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Oh. On all of us?
6577,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
6578,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Even me?
6579,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,"Of course, Your Grace."
6580,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Even Joffrey?
6581,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Joffrey is my-
6582,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
6583,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
6584,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
6585,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,One for her.
6586,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Here. Sit. Drink.
6587,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
6588,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
6589,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
6590,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
6591,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,And if the city should fall?
6592,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
6593,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
6594,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
6595,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,"More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!"
6596,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
6597,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,They're coming. They're coming ashore.
6598,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Rain fire on them.
6599,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Archers!
6600,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,There are too many.
6601,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
6602,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Podrick,"Yes, my lord."
6603,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too."
6604,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts."
6605,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,"Pull, pull! Go!"
6606,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Soldier,Nock! Draw!
6607,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Draw! Draw!
6608,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Kill the Lannisters!
6609,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Loose! Loose!
6610,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Form the line!
6611,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
6612,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
6613,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,"First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!"
6614,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse."
6615,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
6616,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,You were Robert's queen.
6617,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
6618,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Pretty.
6619,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
6620,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
6621,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"A few weeks, Your Grace."
6622,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,When did you leave Lorath?
6623,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
6624,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
6625,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"Ten years ago, Your Grace."
6626,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
6627,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,"Shae, Your Grace."
6628,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Tell us a story, Shae."

6632,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,"The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls."
6633,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Where is Joffrey?
6634,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

6640,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,Not here?
6641,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
6642,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,"No, but I-"
6643,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Now!
6644,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
6645,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Help me!
6646,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Fall back! Fall back!

6652,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"Eat shit, dwarf."
6653,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
6654,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
6655,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!"
6656,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
6657,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.

6665,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,"Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."
6666,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
6667,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,What would you have me do?
6668,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
6669,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?
6670,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,"She did not say, Your Grace."
6671,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,All men to the battlements!
6672,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Joffrey Lannister,"Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle."

6676,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,We need more arrows!
6677,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?
6678,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Who are we fighting for?
6679,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Who leads us?
6680,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
6681,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Yes.
6682,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,What are you talking about?
6683,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
6684,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
6685,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
6686,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
6687,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Heave! Heave! Heave!
6688,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
6689,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,"The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart."
6690,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Where is my son?
6691,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,I want to escort him back to the battle.
6692,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
6693,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Lancel,Now listen to me-
6694,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
6695,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,All,"Save our sons from war, we pray."
6696,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
6697,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Come with me.
6698,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,I need to say goodbye to someone.
6699,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
6700,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,No one is raping me.
6701,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Shae,Go. Run.
6702,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,The lady is starting to panic.
6703,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,What are you doing here?
6704,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,Not here for long. I'm going.
6705,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,Where?
6706,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be."
6707,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,What about the king?
6708,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,He can die just fine on his own.
6709,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
6710,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
6711,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
6712,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
6713,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sansa Stark,You won't hurt me.
6714,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane,"No, little bird, I won't hurt you."
6715,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Heave!
6716,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,"Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!"
6717,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,Attack!
6718,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Men,Roll it over!
6719,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,All,Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
6720,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, fuck me."
6721,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
6722,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tommen Lannister,They're still fighting.
6723,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
6724,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tommen Lannister,The Kingswood?
6725,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
6726,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tommen Lannister,Like what?
6727,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Like stags.
6728,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tommen Lannister,Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
6729,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,And wolves.
6730,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Podrick,My lord.
6731,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
6732,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
6733,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
6734,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
6735,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,"I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
6736,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Man,Back to the boats!
6737,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,"Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!"
6738,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Stannis Baratheon,No!
6739,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Cersei Lannister,Father.
6740,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Tywin Lannister,The battle is over. We have won.
6741,2012-05-27,Season 2,Episode 9,Blackwater,Male Singer,"And who are you,"" the proud lord said / ""That I must bow so low?"" / ""Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours"" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear"
6742,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Pod.
6743,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
6744,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Podrick,"Yes, my lord."
6745,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Pycelle,Would you like something for the pain?
6746,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,What happened?
6747,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Pycelle,The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
6748,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Where am I?
6749,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Pycelle,"These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."
6750,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Pycelle,"Oh, For your trouble."
6751,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King."
6752,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tywin Lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
6753,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward."
6754,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time."
6755,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Petyr Baelish,"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."
6756,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,Ser Loras Tyrell.
6757,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours."
6758,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Loras,"Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."
6759,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
6760,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Margaery Tyrell,"With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
6761,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
6762,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Cersei Lannister,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
6763,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Crowd,Margaery! We want Margaery!
6764,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
6765,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Pycelle,"Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
6766,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Joffrey Lannister,"The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."
6767,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Petyr Baelish,My lady. My sincerest condolences.
6768,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sansa Stark,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
6769,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Petyr Baelish,"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
6770,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sansa Stark,"But, if he's not marrying me-"
6771,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Petyr Baelish,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
6772,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sansa Stark,King's Landing is my home now.
6773,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Petyr Baelish,Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
6774,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
6775,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,"That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me."
6776,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"No need for that, my dear."
6777,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,You sure? Most men like what they see.
6778,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,I'm not like most men.
6779,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,That's what most men say.
6780,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,"If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do."
6781,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
6782,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,Have we met?
6783,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
6784,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,I meet a lot of men.
6785,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
6786,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,"You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor."
6787,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
6788,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,I know who you are.
6789,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
6790,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,How do you know about that?
6791,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,I thought you said you knew who I was.
6792,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,"What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
6793,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
6794,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ros,I'm afraid of him.
6795,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
6796,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
6797,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,Walk.
6798,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
6799,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,One or two tried.
6800,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
6801,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,Not interested.
6802,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
6803,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
6804,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
6805,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
6806,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,What are you doing?
6807,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,Burying them.
6808,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
6809,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
6810,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,I didn't leave it here.
6811,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,I had me dagger.
6812,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Untie me. Now!
6813,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,"I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more."
6814,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,"So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?"
6815,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,Traveling a prisoner.
6816,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,You're a woman. A woman!
6817,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,"Well, fuck me!"
6818,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,If you've quite finished up-
6819,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,"All right, we'll be going."
6820,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
6821,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,The Starks.
6822,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,What did he do?
6823,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
6824,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,"No, stealing is a crime."
6825,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
6826,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Where are you taking him?
6827,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,To Riverrun.
6828,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Why Riverrun?
6829,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
6830,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Why not kill him?
6831,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,For stealing a pig?
6832,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
6833,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Sending him with you? How important could he be?
6834,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,"All right, have it your way, my lady."
6835,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Do I know you?
6836,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Have you been to Ashemark?
6837,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,No.
6838,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Then you don't know me.
6839,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
6840,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Is it near Ashemark?
6841,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,I've never been there.
6842,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,What do you think of these beauties?
6843,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
6844,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,"Two of them we did, yeah."
6845,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
6846,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
6847,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
6848,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
6849,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
6850,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
6851,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,"I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three."
6852,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,Two quick deaths.
6853,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaime Lannister,Those were Stark men.
6854,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne,"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
6855,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Catelyn Stark,Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
6856,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,I know that.
6857,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Catelyn Stark,And you mean to do it anyway?
6858,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,I love her.
6859,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Catelyn Stark,I know that seems important to you.
6860,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,It is important to me.
6861,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Catelyn Stark,"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
6862,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
6863,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Catelyn Stark,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
6864,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
6865,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Catelyn Stark,"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
6866,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
6867,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,You said you saw my victory in the flames.
6868,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,l I did. I still see it.
6869,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
6870,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
6871,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,You claimed to speak for a god.
6872,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
6873,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,You talk about war as if you understand it.
6874,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,I've been fighting far longer than you.
6875,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,Have you? Show me how you fight.
6876,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,Show me.
6877,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
6878,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,Inside you.
6879,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,I murdered my brother.
6880,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,We murdered him. Share the weight with me.
6881,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,He wasn't your brother.
6882,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
6883,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,"You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
6884,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,Let me show you.
6885,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,"Look into the fire, my king. Look."
6886,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,I see fire.
6887,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Melisandre,"Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?"
6888,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Stannis Baratheon,Yes.
6889,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall."
6890,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,They want you to know you're surrounded.
6891,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
6892,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
6893,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
6894,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,No word from my father?
6895,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,No.
6896,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,Send more ravens.
6897,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,You killed all the ravens.
6898,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,The first time I saw Winterfell-
6899,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
6900,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
6901,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
6902,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
6903,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,"Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you."
6904,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
6905,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
6906,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
6907,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
6908,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,"Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
6909,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
6910,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
6911,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,"The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
6912,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
6913,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
6914,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
6915,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,"I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
6916,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
6917,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."
6918,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
6919,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Men,Aye!
6920,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,You think they're right?
6921,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Black Lorren,Aye.
6922,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,"We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
6923,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,Mothers will name their sons for us.
6924,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
6925,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
6926,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Theon Greyjoy,What is dead may never die!
6927,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Men,What is dead may never die!
6928,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Black Lorren,Thought he'd never shut up.
6929,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Dagmer,It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
6930,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,What is this? What are you doing?
6931,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Dagmer,Let's go home.
6932,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Man,Come on.
6933,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Why should I believe you?
6934,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,Why would I lie about it?
6935,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,To create strife between my sister and me.
6936,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
6937,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
6938,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
6939,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Podrick,"No, my lord."
6940,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,"You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
6941,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
6942,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Then my hill tribesmen.
6943,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
6944,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
6945,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
6946,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
6947,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Varys,"Come along now, Podrick."
6948,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,My love.
6949,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,It was good of you to come.
6950,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,Good of me? Of course I come.
6951,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,I want to see you.
6952,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,"Believe me, you don't."
6953,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,Have you looked?
6954,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,I will be the first.
6955,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Well?
6956,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,You are a mess.
6957,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
6958,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,You think I'm here for money?
6959,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
6960,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,"Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave."
6961,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,Leave?
6962,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,"Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here."
6963,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,What would we do in Pentos?
6964,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,"Eat, drink, fuck, live."
6965,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,I want to go with you.
6966,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,"So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me."
6967,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion Lannister,"I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?"
6968,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Shae,You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.
6969,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Septon,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words."

6971,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Talisa,"Father, smith, warrior, mother,maiden, crone, stranger."
6972,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Robb Stark,I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.
6973,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Talisa,I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.
6974,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Kovarro,"A house of ghosts, Khaleesi."
6975,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Kovarro,Where are the guards?
6976,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jorah Mormont,"No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel."
6977,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,Let them try.
6978,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,Is this a riddle?
6979,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jorah Mormont,Khaleesi! Khaleesi!
6980,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?
6981,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Hot Pie,How did he find us?
6982,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,What are you doing here?
6983,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,Waiting for you.
6984,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,How did you know we'd come this way?
6985,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,"After all the things you have seen, this is your question?"
6986,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
6987,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,"No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way."
6988,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,"Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too."
6989,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,"If you would learn, you must come with me."
6990,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,Where?

6992,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,My dancing master was from Braavos.
6993,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,"To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one."
6994,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,"I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too."
6995,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,Then we must part. A man has duties as well. Here.
6996,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,What is it?
6997,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,A coin of great value.
6998,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,Could it buy a horse?
6999,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,It is not meant for the buying of horses.
7000,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Arya Stark,Then what good is it?
7001,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jaqen Hghar,"If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, ""Valar Morghulis."""

7007,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Bran Stark,"Osha, what are you doing?"
7008,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Bran Stark,Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
7009,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Rickon,We'll make you better.
7010,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,I feel just fine.
7011,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Bran Stark,They burned it down. They burned everything.
7012,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
7013,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Osha,North's the wrong way. And mother and brother are south. We don't know where.
7014,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,"There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe."
7015,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Bran Stark,I don't want to leave you.
7016,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,"No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here."
7017,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,Osha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind.
7018,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Osha,I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it.
7019,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,I don't want milk of the poppy.
7020,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Luwin,Do it quickly.
7021,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Drogo,Moon of my life.
7022,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,"This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands."
7023,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Drogo,Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
7024,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,That sounds like something you would do.
7025,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Drogo,"Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms."
7026,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Drogo,You are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know.
7027,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Drogo,"And if this is a dream, I will kill the man who tries to wake me."
7028,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,"Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."

7042,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys.
7043,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ygritte,"We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go."
7044,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jon Snow,Careful with that. You might cut yourself.
7045,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jon Snow,"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle."
7046,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Rattleshirt,Enough of that!

7050,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Qhorin,That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.

7052,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Qhorin,Or was it your whore mother?
7053,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Qhorin,We are the watchers on the Wall.
7054,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Ygritte,You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.

7073,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Daenerys Targaryen,Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?
7074,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jorah Mormont,"Aye, a small ship."
7075,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Jorah Mormont,Take all the gold and jewels.
7076,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Grenn,I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.
7077,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Grenn,Is this goat?
7078,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Dolorous Edd,It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
7079,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Grenn,"Well, you see a tree, let me know."
7080,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,"If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is"
7081,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Grenn,Just bloody kill me.
7082,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,"No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better."
7083,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Dolorous Edd,The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.
7084,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
7085,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
7086,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Grenn,Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone.
7087,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Dolorous Edd,Come on.
7088,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Grenn,Three blasts?
7089,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Dolorous Edd,Run!
7090,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,Wait! Wait for me!
7091,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,Grenn!
7092,2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,Sam,Edd!
7093,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Man,Fall back!
7094,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sam,Brother?
7095,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jeor,Did you send the ravens?
7096,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jeor,"Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?"
7097,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jeor,"That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead."
7098,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Main,CREDITS
7099,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,"First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?"
7100,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,"Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail."
7101,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Man,Crow!
7102,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Boy,Crow!
7103,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Girl,Look over there!
7104,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Girl,Crow! Look over here! Look!
7105,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Woman,"Ah, look, crow coming!"
7106,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,You're wearing the wrong color.
7107,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,Mance was a ranger.
7108,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free."
7109,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
7110,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,"Sure, you will."
7111,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Boy,Oh!
7112,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,"And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul."
7113,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,What happened to their fathers?
7114,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,"Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't..."
7115,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,I smell a crow.
7116,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Rattleshirt,We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
7117,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,What do we want with a baby crow?
7118,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ygritte,This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
7119,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
7120,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
7121,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?"
7122,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,Jon Snow.
7123,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,Your Grace.
7124,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,"Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart."
7125,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,"Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall."
7126,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,"So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us."
7127,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,"The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?"
7128,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,"Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls."
7129,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
7130,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tormund,Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
7131,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
7132,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
7133,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
7134,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,Why?
7135,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,He wants me to lead one day.
7136,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,"But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall."
7137,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
7138,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?"
7139,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,I want to be free.
7140,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?"
7141,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
7142,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,You saw what?
7143,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
7144,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
7145,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jon Snow,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
7146,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Mance,We'll need to find you a new cloak.
7147,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,What if you took off that bit there?
7148,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Whore,Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
7149,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
7150,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Whore,I want you to take it off.
7151,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Whore,Mouth.
7152,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Podrick,Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
7153,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,I didn't hear that.
7154,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Podrick,"Apologies, ser."
7155,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
7156,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Podrick,Lord Tyrion sent me.
7157,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,"I will murder you, boy."
7158,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Podrick,He said it was a matter of life and death.
7159,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Pod?
7160,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,It's your sister. The queen.
7161,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,What are they doing here?
7162,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
7163,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"No, I don't think so."
7164,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
7165,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,They stay outside.
7166,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
7167,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Why are you here?
7168,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
7169,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
7170,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
7171,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
7172,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
7173,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
7174,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,You're meeting Father today?
7175,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,How do you know that?
7176,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
7177,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
7178,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,You're going to make me cry.
7179,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Why do you care what I want from him?
7180,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
7181,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Slandered? When?
7182,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
7183,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
7184,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"I was nine, too."
7185,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
7186,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
7187,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,It's not slander if it's true.
7188,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
7189,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
7190,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
7191,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Any lies in particular?
7192,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
7193,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Still makes me more clever than you.
7194,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
7195,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Meryn Trant,Ser Meryn Trant.
7196,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
7197,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Meryn Trant,You're no knight.
7198,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,Pod.
7199,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Podrick,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
7200,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Meryn Trant,"You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more."
7201,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
7202,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Meryn Trant,"You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand."
7203,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
7204,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
7205,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,I've been doing that for a while now.
7206,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Do you grow bored protecting me?
7207,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,I grow poor protecting you.
7208,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
7209,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,Briefly.
7210,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
7211,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
7212,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,I thought we were friends.
7213,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
7214,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,How much?
7215,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,Double.
7216,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Double?
7217,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
7218,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
7219,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Bronn,Which means you can afford it.
7220,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,Here. Here! Help me!
7221,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Man,Who are you?
7222,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
7223,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Man,"Aye, ser, and serving which king?"
7224,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
7225,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
7226,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,He may have swam ashore as you did.
7227,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
7228,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,"I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father."
7229,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
7230,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
7231,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,Will you take me there?
7232,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
7233,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,This war is not over.
7234,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,"Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over."
7235,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,We're both sworn to King Stannis.
7236,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
7237,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
7238,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,"He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive."
7239,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,What?
7240,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
7241,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,I'm a pirate.
7242,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,You're a smuggler.
7243,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
7244,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"Take me back there, please."
7245,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,You cannot turn Stannis against her.
7246,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
7247,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,"You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend."
7248,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
7249,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,"And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors."
7250,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
7251,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor,"When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck."
7252,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Roose Bolton,We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.
7253,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Robb Stark,There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
7254,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Roose Bolton,I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
7255,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Robb Stark,The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
7256,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Rickard Karstark,Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
7257,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Roose Bolton,"The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons."
7258,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Rickard Karstark,Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
7259,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Roose Bolton,The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
7260,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Robb Stark,A Mallister?
7261,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Catelyn Stark,Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
7262,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Robb Stark,Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
7263,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Talisa,She's your mother.
7264,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Robb Stark,She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
7265,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Qyburn,Water. Water.
7266,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Talisa,This needs to be cleaned and closed.
7267,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Robb Stark,"What's your name, friend?"
7268,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Qyburn,Qyburn.
7269,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Talisa,You're lucky to be alive.
7270,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Qyburn,Lucky?
7271,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
7272,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,Am I enjoying it?
7273,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
7274,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,Yes. I heard how happy you were.
7275,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,blows on his paper to dry the ink.
7276,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,You brought a whore into my bed.
7277,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,It wasn't your bed at the time.
7278,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
7279,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
7280,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,"What do you want, Tyrion?"
7281,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
7282,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
7283,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
7284,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
7285,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,"I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
7286,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,You want Casterly Rock?
7287,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,It is mine by right.
7288,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,"We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
7289,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tyrion Lannister,Why?
7290,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
7291,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Tywin Lannister,"Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
7292,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
7293,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,Why Dorne?
7294,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
7295,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
7296,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,Don't ruin the game.
7297,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,"I told you, I don't want to play."
7298,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,What about that one there?
7299,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,That one? It's going to Volantis.
7300,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,Why?
7301,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,"Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one."
7302,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
7303,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
7304,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
7305,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Petyr Baelish,Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
7306,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,Lord Baelish.
7307,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Petyr Baelish,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
7308,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Petyr Baelish,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
7309,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
7310,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Petyr Baelish,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
7311,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,I won't tell anyone.
7312,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Petyr Baelish,How do I know?
7313,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Sansa Stark,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
7314,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Petyr Baelish,"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
7315,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ros,You're her handmaiden?
7316,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,Yes. And you're his...?
7317,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ros,I help manage his affairs.
7318,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,He's an important person.
7319,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ros,"So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
7320,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,Yes.
7321,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ros,Given where we started.
7322,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,And where is that?
7323,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ros,It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
7324,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Shae,I always do.
7325,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Ros,Watch out for her with him.
7326,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,They're growing fast.
7327,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
7328,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
7329,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
7330,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
7331,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
7332,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
7333,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
7334,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,"The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."
7335,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,Your Grace.
7336,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Stannis Baratheon,I heard you were dead.
7337,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,Not yet.
7338,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Stannis Baratheon,"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
7339,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Stannis Baratheon,We are alone.
7340,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
7341,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Stannis Baratheon,I am fighting.
7342,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,By burning prisoners alive?
7343,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,"How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
7344,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,"I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
7345,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,I'm not your enemy.
7346,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,You are my enemy.
7347,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,"Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
7348,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,"Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true."
7349,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,Death by fire is the purest death.
7350,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
7351,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Stannis Baratheon,Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
7352,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,Your Grace!
7353,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Guard,Come on.
7354,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,"You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos."
7355,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Davos,She will destroy us all!
7356,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Melisandre,I will pray for you.
7357,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Guard,Guard
7358,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Guard,Guard #2
7359,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,Why have we stopped?
7360,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Guard,"It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace."
7361,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
7362,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Maid,"My lady. We should have guards, my lady."
7363,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,Why?
7364,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,Pardon me.
7365,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Maid,"Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress."
7366,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,I have others.
7367,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Guard,"Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?"
7368,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,No.
7369,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Child,He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
7370,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,And your mother?
7371,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Child,She died when she had me.
7372,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them."
7373,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father."
7374,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Child,He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
7375,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
7376,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"Was your father a soldier, too?"
7377,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you."
7378,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me."
7379,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,Your Grace.
7380,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Loras,Your Grace.
7381,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,"Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
7382,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,"That's a lovely gown, my lady."
7383,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
7384,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace."
7385,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,"Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"
7386,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?"
7387,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Loras,Yes.
7388,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
7389,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
7390,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
7391,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Loras,Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
7392,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
7393,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
7394,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
7395,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,"You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
7396,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Margaery Tyrell,"Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
7397,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Joffrey Lannister,"Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."
7398,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Cersei Lannister,I'm sure she does.
7399,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
7400,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,They will stand until they drop.
7401,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,Such is their obedience.
7402,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
7403,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,"The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained."
7404,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
7405,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,"They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training."
7406,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
7407,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,Even the bravest men fear death.
7408,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,The knight says even brave men fear death.
7409,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,Tell the old man he smells of piss.
7410,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,"Truly, master?"
7411,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,"No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?"
7412,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
7413,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
7414,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,"He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace."
7415,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,Tell the good master there is no need.
7416,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
7417,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,My master points out that men don't need nipples.
7418,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,"Here, I'm done with you."
7419,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Unsullied,This one is pleased to have served you.
7420,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,"To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them."
7421,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
7422,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
7423,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,What a soft mewling fool this one is.
7424,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,"My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother."
7425,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,How many do you have to sell?
7426,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,Eight thousand.
7427,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Kraznys Mo Nakloz,Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
7428,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Missandei,Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
7429,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,Eight thousand dead babies.
7430,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,The Unsullied are a means to an end.
7431,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,"Once I own them, these men..."
7432,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,They're not men. Not anymore.
7433,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
7434,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
7435,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
7436,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
7437,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,The warlocks.
7438,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,"I owe you my life, Ser."
7439,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Barristan,"The honor is mine, my queen."
7440,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Daenerys Targaryen,You know this man?
7441,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Jorah Mormont,I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
7442,2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,Barristan,"King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them."
7443,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,"Don't think too much, Bran."
7444,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,Relax your bow arm.
7445,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Eddard Stark,And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
7446,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Father?
7447,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,"You can't kill it, you know."
7448,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Why not?
7449,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,Because the raven is you.
7450,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Hodor,Hodor.
7451,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,"It's all right, Hodor."
7452,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?"
7453,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,"No, it was the three-eyed raven."
7454,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,He's back.
7455,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,"I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy."
7456,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,I don't want to hear about it.
7457,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,But you asked.
7458,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
7459,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
7460,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"I know you didn't, little lord."
7461,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,We need to move.
7462,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
7463,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
7464,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,No.
7465,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"Some good he is, then."
7466,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
7467,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,"My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds."
7468,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
7469,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
7470,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,Never?
7471,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians."
7472,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Roose Bolton,"Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen."
7473,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,Lord Bolton.
7474,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,Let me guess which one is the good news.
7475,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Roose Bolton,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
7476,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
7477,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
7478,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
7479,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,Something else?
7480,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
7481,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,Have you received any demands?
7482,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,No.
7483,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
7484,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
7485,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,I want to do this.
7486,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
7487,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Yes.
7488,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,So how shall we pass the time?
7489,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,By putting one foot in front of the other.
7490,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,It's going to be a very dull walk.
7491,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
7492,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
7493,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
7494,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,All the good it's done her.
7495,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
7496,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,"Not your concern, Kingslayer."
7497,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
7498,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,How would you know?
7499,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
7500,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Move.
7501,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Were you pledged to Stannis?
7502,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,"Gods, no."
7503,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
7504,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Shut your mouth.
7505,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
7506,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,"I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
7507,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Sounds like you quite fancied him.
7508,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,I did not fancy him.
7509,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Oh, gods, you did."
7510,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
7511,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
7512,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,I'm not interested in foul rumors.
7513,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
7514,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Shut your mouth!
7515,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
7516,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,"Where are you headed, then?"
7517,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,South. You?
7518,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,"Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
7519,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"No, you really can't."
7520,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,"Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
7521,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,And you.
7522,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,He knows who I am.
7523,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,He doesn't.
7524,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
7525,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
7526,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
7527,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Make it tighter here.
7528,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,That's better. It makes you look very strong.
7529,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
7530,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tailor,"Yes, Your Grace."
7531,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Bloody flowers. On the king.
7532,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
7533,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,Tell me what you think of her.
7534,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Who?
7535,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,Margaery.
7536,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,"She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
7537,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
7538,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,"Yes, she is."
7539,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
7540,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Not to me.
7541,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
7542,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
7543,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
7544,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
7545,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Cersei Lannister,You need to ask yourself
7546,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,I don't need to do anything.
7547,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Better. Much better.
7548,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,I still don't believe it.
7549,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
7550,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
7551,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.
7552,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,Love is not the thing he wants.
7553,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,He's too old.
7554,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?
7555,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,No.
7556,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
7557,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
7558,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Guard,"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
7559,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,Send him in.
7560,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Loras,Lady Sansa.
7561,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,Ser Loras.
7562,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Loras,"My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?"
7563,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Loras,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
7564,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
7565,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Loras,Of course I did.
7566,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,It's more your color. You take it.
7567,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Maid,Thank you.
7568,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,You're such a dear.
7569,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Loras,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
7570,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
7571,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
7572,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Kiss me, child."
7573,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
7574,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
7575,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
7576,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
7577,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
7578,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
7579,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
7580,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.
7581,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
7582,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
7583,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,I haven't had the pleasure.
7584,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
7585,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,"I-, I-"
7586,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
7587,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?
7588,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
7589,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
7590,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
7591,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,Bring me some cheese.
7592,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Servant,"The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
7593,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
7594,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
7595,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,My father always told the truth.
7596,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
7597,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
7598,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,Go on.
7599,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
7600,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
7601,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
7602,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,He's a monster.
7603,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.
7604,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sansa Stark,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
7605,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Olenna Tyrell,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
7606,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,We're at war. This march is a distraction.
7607,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
7608,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
7609,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,Then it's a distraction.
7610,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
7611,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
7612,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,Have you lost faith in our cause?
7613,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
7614,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,If you no longer believe-
7615,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.
7616,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,You don't think we can win?
7617,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
7618,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Robb Stark,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
7619,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rickard Karstark,I think you lost this war the day you married her.
7620,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,"Whoa, whoa."
7621,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,Your Grace.
7622,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
7623,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,"I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
7624,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,No.
7625,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
7626,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
7627,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,You've made them before?
7628,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,Twice.
7629,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,Did they work?
7630,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
7631,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
7632,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,Which boy?
7633,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
7634,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Talisa,And he lived.
7635,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Catelyn Stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
7636,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
7637,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,Yes.
7638,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people."
7639,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,I understand.
7640,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,"Well, how could you understand?"
7641,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,You want to protect your people.
7642,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
7643,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,No.
7644,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.
7645,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tormund,Shouldn't be long now.
7646,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jon Snow,What's wrong with him?
7647,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,"He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us."
7648,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Ygritte,"What, you've never met a warg?"
7649,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,Orell.
7650,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,Where were you this time?
7651,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Orell,The Fist of the First Men.
7652,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Mance,What did you see?
7653,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Orell,Dead crows.
7654,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,"What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to."
7655,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,"Hey. Get up, Sam."
7656,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sam,No.
7657,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,Get up.
7658,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sam,I can't.
7659,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,"If you stop, you'll die."
7660,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Dolorous Edd,"Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too."
7661,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sam,You don't care.
7662,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Dolorous Edd,Course we care.
7663,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sam,"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
7664,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Dolorous Edd,"Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die."
7665,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,Help me get him up.
7666,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,Looks like that piggy is done for.
7667,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,Help us get him up.
7668,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,He's slowing us down.
7669,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,Just get him up!
7670,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
7671,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jeor,"What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?"
7672,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Grenn,"Aye, I think so."
7673,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,"If he can't, we may as well just go without him."
7674,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jeor,"That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?"
7675,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,Why should the rest of us-
7676,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jeor,"Rast, you're responsible for him."
7677,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,What am I supposed to do?
7678,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jeor,"Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!"
7679,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Rast,"I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?"
7680,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Where's Rickon and Hodor?
7681,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,Looking for food.
7682,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,What's out there?
7683,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood."
7684,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,I'm unarmed.
7685,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,That was poor planning.
7686,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,My sister carries the weapons.
7687,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Meera,I'm better with them. Drop the spear.
7688,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Meera,Drop it.
7689,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits."
7690,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,You must be SUMMER.
7691,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,"I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go."
7692,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,I'm just trying to understand.
7693,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Would you please shut up about it?
7694,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
7695,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,I'm not listening.
7696,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
7697,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Shut up.
7698,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
7699,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
7700,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,But you could have ended the war.
7701,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Where are we going?
7702,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,North.
7703,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
7704,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,Maybe we already passed it.
7705,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
7706,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,Could be a minstrel.
7707,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,A lion still has claws...
7708,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Hot Pie,"A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
7709,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Shh.
7710,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"And so he spoke, and so he spoke"
7711,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
7712,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,"Just a dirty little cub, I think."
7713,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Loose a few more shafts.
7714,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Don't.
7715,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"Put the sword down, girl."
7716,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
7717,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,Generous.
7718,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
7719,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,What friends?
7720,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
7721,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
7722,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Who are you?
7723,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
7724,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,"No, who do you fight for?"
7725,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
7726,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Hot Pie,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
7727,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
7728,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,"Here's the thing, fat"
7729,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,"When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
7730,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,Half the country's starving and look at this one.
7731,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
7732,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,My lion.
7733,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
7734,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,But you said I should come to you with any problems.
7735,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,Did anyone see you? No.
7736,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,No.
7737,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
7738,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,All right. What is this problem?
7739,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
7740,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,Baelish doesn't have friends.
7741,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,I don't know her name.
7742,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
7743,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,How do you know her?
7744,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
7745,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,She's a whore.
7746,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
7747,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,You fucked her.
7748,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
7749,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
7750,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,And was she good? Did you like her?
7751,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
7752,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
7753,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
7754,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,We have to protect her.
7755,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
7756,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
7757,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
7758,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,You pervert. You want her? This child?
7759,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.
7760,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,But you are.
7761,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,Only because you're making me.
7762,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
7763,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
7764,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
7765,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,"Hmm, yes."
7766,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Shae,Now do you think I'm cruel?
7767,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
7768,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Tyrion Lannister,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
7769,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Guard,"Lady Tyrell, my king."
7770,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Send her in.
7771,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
7772,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
7773,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
7774,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
7775,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
7776,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
7777,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
7778,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
7779,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
7780,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,You failed to do this.
7781,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
7782,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
7783,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
7784,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,What makes you say this?
7785,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
7786,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,"No, he was a known degenerate."
7787,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
7788,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
7789,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
7790,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,You are the king.
7791,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Yes. I am.
7792,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
7793,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
7794,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
7795,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,The bolt goes here.
7796,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,And then you just aim and-
7797,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
7798,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,It's not unheard of.
7799,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,My father would never let me before-
7800,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?
7801,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,May I? Please.
7802,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
7803,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
7804,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
7805,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffrey Lannister,Yes.
7806,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Margaery Tyrell,Would you like to watch me?
7807,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,Stop! Stop!
7808,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,Tell us the truth.
7809,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,About what?
7810,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,I don't know what you want.
7811,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,I want the truth.
7812,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,What truth?
7813,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,Why'd you take Winterfell?
7814,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,I took it to-I took it-
7815,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,Who gave the orders?
7816,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,No one. I took it on my own.
7817,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,Why?
7818,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
7819,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,What were you going to do once you took it?
7820,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,Hold it. Rule it.
7821,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,Good. That's very good.
7822,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,Why did you do that?
7823,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Torturer,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
7824,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
7825,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
7826,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,What are you doing?
7827,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,Please.
7828,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
7829,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Ramsay Bolton,Your sister sent me.
7830,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,Yara?
7831,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Ramsay Bolton,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
7832,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Theon Greyjoy,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
7833,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"Rickon, stay with us."
7834,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
7835,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
7836,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Only when I'm asleep.
7837,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
7838,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
7839,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,A three-eyed raven?
7840,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,You've seen it?
7841,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
7842,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Does it have anything to do with warging?
7843,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
7844,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
7845,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
7846,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,What's he telling him?
7847,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Meera,Why don't you ask?
7848,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
7849,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Meera,Where's the shame in that?
7850,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Osha,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
7851,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Meera,Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
7852,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,"When my father died, I dreamt it."
7853,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
7854,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,"You have the sight, too?"
7855,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,"When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
7856,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
7857,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,Yeah.
7858,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
7859,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
7860,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Bran Stark,What else have you seen?
7861,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jojen,Only one thing that matters-you.
7862,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,"I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
7863,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,I don't drink ale.
7864,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
7865,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,Yeah!
7866,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
7867,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,We're not children.
7868,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
7869,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
7870,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
7871,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
7872,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
7873,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Gendry Baratheon,That's because he's twice as good.
7874,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Aha! A smith and a salesman.
7875,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,Gendry stole us weapons.
7876,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
7877,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
7878,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,My brothers taught me.
7879,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Men,Ooh!
7880,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,To your brothers!
7881,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
7882,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Arya Stark,You'll free us?
7883,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,I gave you my word.
7884,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
7885,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,"Hey, hey."
7886,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
7887,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Anguy,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
7888,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Poor man. You have my sympathy.
7889,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
7890,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"So good to see you again, Clegane."
7891,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sandor Clegane,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
7892,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
7893,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Thoros,"A pretty prize, lads."
7894,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Men,Yeah!
7895,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sandor Clegane,Girl.
7896,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Sandor Clegane,What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
7897,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
7898,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,"Silence, Kingslayer."
7899,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
7900,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Good luck.
7901,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
7902,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
7903,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Be quick about it.
7904,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,I need to rest.
7905,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Get up.
7906,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
7907,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Brienne,Get up now.
7908,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
7909,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
7910,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
7911,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
7912,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
7913,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
7914,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
7915,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
7916,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Locke,"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
7917,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
7918,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Locke,You sure he's the one?
7919,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Man,"That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
7920,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Locke,Give the man his silver.
7921,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Jaime Lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
7922,2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Locke,"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
7923,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,"If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-"
7924,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,"Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
7925,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,Robb knows I meant him no disr-
7926,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
7927,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,"My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
7928,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
7929,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,I seized an opportunity.
7930,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,What value was the mill?
7931,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
7932,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,Is he there now? Of course not.
7933,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
7934,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
7935,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
7936,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
7937,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,"Martyn is fifteen, I believe."
7938,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
7939,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,No.
7940,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
7941,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,How many men did you lose?
7942,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,"But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-"
7943,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
7944,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Edmure,I'm sorry. I didn't know.
7945,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
7946,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,We seem to be running short of patience here.
7947,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Robb Stark,You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
7948,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
7949,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,What news of Jaime?
7950,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
7951,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Varys,"We are trying, my lord."
7952,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,"Try harder. What do we have, then?"
7953,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Varys,"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
7954,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,"Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
7955,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
7956,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Pycelle,A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
7957,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,Titles do seem to breed titles.
7958,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
7959,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
7960,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
7961,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Master of Coin?
7962,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tywin Lannister,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
7963,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
7964,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Cersei Lannister,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
7965,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Pycelle,"Hear, hear."
7966,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Men,"He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."
7967,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
7968,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,You were armed when we were taken.
7969,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
7970,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
7971,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
7972,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
7973,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,You were not beating me.
7974,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
7975,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
7976,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,Would I?
7977,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,They'll knock your teeth out.
7978,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,You think I care about my teeth?
7979,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
7980,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,What does it matter?
7981,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
7982,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
7983,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
7984,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Gendry Baratheon,"If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
7985,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Thoros,Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
7986,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
7987,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Thoros,"You're not our prisoner, little lady."
7988,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,What am I?
7989,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Thoros,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
7990,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,"So I can walk away, then?"
7991,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Thoros,These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.
7992,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Sandor Clegane,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
7993,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Anguy,Better than anyone you've ever met.
7994,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Sandor Clegane,A cowardo s weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
7995,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Anguy,Why? So you can kiss him?
7996,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,You remember the last time you were here?
7997,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Sandor Clegane,Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
7998,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Anguy,"Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more."
7999,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Anguy,Watch your head. Off we go.
8000,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Driver,Walk up!
8001,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,What are you doing? We're about to leave.
8002,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,I'm staying.
8003,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Gendry Baratheon,You're what?
8004,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,"I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of ""Winterhell""."
8005,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,Winterfell.
8006,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,You sure?
8007,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,I'm sure.
8008,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,"Well, I made you something."
8009,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,What is it?
8010,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,It's a wolf.
8011,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Gendry Baratheon,"Yes, it is."
8012,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,That's the tail?
8013,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,Yeah.
8014,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Gendry Baratheon,"Well, be safe."
8015,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,"Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed."
8016,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Gendry Baratheon,You don't burn your fingers.
8017,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,"Good-bye, Hot Pie."
8018,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Hot Pie,"Good-bye, Arry."
8019,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,"Up you go, little lady."
8020,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Arya Stark,"Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
8021,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Catelyn Stark,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
8022,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,"It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
8023,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Catelyn Stark,"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
8024,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
8025,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Catelyn Stark,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
8026,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,"After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
8027,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Catelyn Stark,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
8028,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brynden,You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
8029,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Martyn,You're Robb Stark's wife.
8030,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Talisa,Hold still.
8031,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Martyn,Is it true what they say about him?
8032,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Talisa,I don't know. What do they say about him?
8033,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Martyn,That he can turn into a wolf at night.
8034,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Talisa,True.
8035,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Martyn,And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
8036,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Talisa,"True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
8037,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Martyn,Martyn Lannister.
8038,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Talisa,"Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear."
8039,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,Always the artists.
8040,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jon Snow,It's only horses. No men.
8041,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ygritte,You said there was dead crows.
8042,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Orell,There was.
8043,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,How many men were here?
8044,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jon Snow,About three hundred.
8045,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,And you know what those men are now?
8046,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,We're all the same to them - meat for their army.
8047,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jon Snow,Do you think anyone got away?
8048,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,"It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
8049,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tormund,"We're finally going to war, old friend?"
8050,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,"Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side."
8051,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tormund,We'll meet again.
8052,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,Aye. If you do your job. Ah.
8053,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Orell,How will we see your signal?
8054,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Mance,"Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen."
8055,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Sam,Ghost?
8056,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,What have we here? Frozen crows?
8057,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jeor,We've come a long way.
8058,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,Smaller flock than you went north with.
8059,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jeor,We can talk inside.
8060,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,"Oh, can we?"
8061,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Woman,They need some water.
8062,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Woman,Tether it and I'll be inside.
8063,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.
8064,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Karl Tanner,Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
8065,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,"Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
8066,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jeor,You are a godly man?
8067,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,"I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
8068,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Craster,"Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."
8069,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Woman,Here we are.
8070,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Woman,"Sharpen these for me, would ya?"
8071,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Woman,I see the head. Push.
8072,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Woman,That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
8073,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Gilly,What is it? What is it?
8074,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,Keep quiet.
8075,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,"If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance."
8076,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,I can ride.
8077,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,You're sure?
8078,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
8079,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
8080,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
8081,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
8082,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,Come on back.
8083,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
8084,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
8085,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,How long will you be gone?
8086,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,I don't know.
8087,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,You're abandoning me.
8088,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you.
8089,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,Then serve me.
8090,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,"When I return, you will understand."
8091,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
8092,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,I cannot.
8093,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,Why?
8094,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
8095,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
8096,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,I want you.
8097,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,"Your fires burn low, my king."
8098,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,There is another way. A better way.
8099,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
8100,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,Yes.
8101,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Stannis Baratheon,I'm the one true king.
8102,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Melisandre,"You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."
8103,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,"The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace."
8104,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,To whom?
8105,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
8106,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,Give me your water.
8107,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."
8108,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"Here, drink."
8109,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,"Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you."
8110,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,And what is she to do for soldiers?
8111,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
8112,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
8113,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
8114,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
8115,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,Three.
8116,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
8117,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
8118,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
8119,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,"When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."
8120,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
8121,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
8122,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,"I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
8123,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
8124,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
8125,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,They did not. I want to buy them all.
8126,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,She wants to buy them all.
8127,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,"She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
8128,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
8129,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
8130,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Greizhen,"If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor."
8131,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
8132,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
8133,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,The slut cannot pay for all of this.
8134,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
8135,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,"Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more."
8136,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
8137,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
8138,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,The gold you have left is worth ten.
8139,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
8140,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.
8141,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
8142,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,The Dothraki you have with you-
8143,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,I will give her three for those.
8144,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
8145,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,"So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
8146,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
8147,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,I have dragons. I'll give you one.
8148,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,"You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."
8149,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"Khaleesi, please."
8150,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,Three dragons.
8151,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,One.
8152,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,Two.
8153,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,They want the biggest one.
8154,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,Done.
8155,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Kraznys,Done.
8156,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
8157,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
8158,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jorah Mormont,"Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
8159,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Barristan,Aegon Targaryen proved that.
8160,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
8161,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,Do you have a name?
8162,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
8163,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
8164,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"No, Your Grace. No family living."
8165,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
8166,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
8167,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
8168,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
8169,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
8170,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,"All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
8171,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
8172,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Missandei,Valar morghulis.
8173,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, all men must die. But we are not men."
8174,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
8175,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
8176,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Not for bastards.
8177,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ros,"That's all of them, my lord."
8178,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,"Thank you, my dear."
8179,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
8180,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,"Yes, my lord."
8181,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
8182,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
8183,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,You should have him knighted.
8184,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
8185,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
8186,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
8187,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
8188,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,We don't. I did fuck her once.
8189,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,I know.
8190,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,But we don't.
8191,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
8192,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
8193,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,Keep a low profile.
8194,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
8195,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,"Well, you are richer than I am."
8196,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Good point.
8197,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Petyr Baelish,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
8198,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
8199,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,"Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
8200,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,"Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
8201,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,You think all reading is dull reading.
8202,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
8203,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
8204,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
8205,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
8206,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Podrick.
8207,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
8208,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
8209,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,"No, my lord."
8210,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
8211,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,"She's not bad with second-timers, either."
8212,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,"Uh, my lord"
8213,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
8214,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
8215,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Marei,He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
8216,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
8217,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,"My lord, I don't even"
8218,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
8219,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Be back in time for my supper.
8220,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,"Pace yourself, lad."
8221,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
8222,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
8223,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,No.
8224,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,He's stealing it?
8225,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
8226,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,What's wrong with that?
8227,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
8228,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
8229,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
8230,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
8231,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
8232,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,And what if I don't?
8233,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, you have to."
8234,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,But what if I don't?
8235,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
8236,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
8237,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,The lado s practically skipping.
8238,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
8239,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
8240,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,He's a squire. You don't pay him.
8241,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
8242,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,"They wouldn't take it, my lord."
8243,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
8244,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
8245,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,What did you tell them?
8246,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,I didn't tell them anything.
8247,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,What did you do to them?
8248,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,Lots of things.
8249,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,And they seemed to like these things?
8250,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
8251,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Only they weren't paid.
8252,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Bronn,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
8253,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,Is that what you're telling us?
8254,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Podrick,doesn't deny it.>/i>
8255,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,"Sit down, Podrick."
8256,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Tyrion Lannister,We're going to need details. Copious details.
8257,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
8258,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Soldier,Ha! Ha!
8259,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Soldier,"You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?"
8260,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Soldier,Take off his pants.
8261,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,"No! No! No, no, no!"
8262,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Soldier,I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
8263,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,"No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!"
8264,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Theon Greyjoy,"No, please! No! No!"
8265,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Soldier,You little bastard.
8266,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,"Come, my lord."
8267,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Ramsay Bolton,You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
8268,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off."
8269,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Brienne,"My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
8270,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
8271,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,You're only making it worse.
8272,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
8273,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,Come on!
8274,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"You know who she is, don't you?"
8275,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
8276,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
8277,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,I'm gonna cut your throat!
8278,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
8279,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,I know what they are.
8280,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
8281,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Bring her back here.
8282,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,"Yes, my lord. Get up."
8283,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,Come on.
8284,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,"Come on, on your feet."
8285,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Unbesmirched.
8286,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,Not defiled.
8287,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Fancy word for a fancy man.
8288,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
8289,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,I bet you did.
8290,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"
8291,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
8292,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"Aye, you have both."
8293,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
8294,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Hard to argue with that.
8295,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
8296,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
8297,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Man,"Come on, men."
8298,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
8299,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"I'm famished, actually."
8300,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
8301,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"Well, I do like partridge."
8302,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?"
8303,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
8304,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,On the stump.
8305,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
8306,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,My father-
8307,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone."
8308,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Jaime Lannister,Don't.
8309,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,Have you got something to say?
8310,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that."
8311,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,Locke,"Here, this should help you remember."
8312,2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,End,CREDITS
8313,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Man,How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
8314,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Locke,"Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?"
8315,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Brienne,He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
8316,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Jaime Lannister,"Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
8317,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Jaime Lannister,"If I die, you won't be getting-"
8318,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Locke,"Oh, enough. Here."
8319,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Locke,Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
8320,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Brienne,Stop!
8321,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Man,Far enough.
8322,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Locke,Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
8323,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Man,"Come on, you."
8324,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
8325,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,I hope we might speak. In confidence.
8326,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"Oh, always in confidence."
8327,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
8328,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
8329,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
8330,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,End your life?
8331,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
8332,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Proof? Will there be a trial?
8333,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,I need to know.
8334,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
8335,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,I don't know. Do I?
8336,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
8337,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
8338,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,You do not possess at the moment.
8339,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
8340,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Tyrion Lannister,The sorcerer.
8341,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
8342,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Grenn,"When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
8343,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Dolorous Edd,Or the shit.
8344,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Grenn,"They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
8345,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Dolorous Edd,And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
8346,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Grenn,"But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
8347,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Dolorous Edd,"Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
8348,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Rast,We need to get out of here.
8349,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Grenn,"When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
8350,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Rast,The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
8351,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Dolorous Edd,He had no way of knowing.
8352,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Rast,We do now. We know what's out there.
8353,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Grenn,Craster's been out here surviving.
8354,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Rast,So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
8355,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Dolorous Edd,We're like the sons he never had.
8356,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Rast,"Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."
8357,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,"Shh, shh, shh."
8358,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,You woke him.
8359,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sam,I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
8360,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,Shh!
8361,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sam,He's beautiful. Does he have a name?
8362,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,No.
8363,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sam,Are you going to give him one?
8364,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,Why?
8365,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,Here.
8366,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sam,Gilly.
8367,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
8368,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sam,I wanted you to have it.
8369,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
8370,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gilly,I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
8371,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Jojen,You have to go after him.
8372,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Bran Stark,How?
8373,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Jojen,You know how.
8374,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Catelyn Stark,Brandon.
8375,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Bran Stark,Mother.
8376,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Catelyn Stark,How many times have I told you? No climbing.
8377,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Bran Stark,"Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
8378,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Catelyn Stark,I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
8379,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Catelyn Stark,Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
8380,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Bran Stark,Mother! Mother!
8381,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Catelyn Stark,"Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
8382,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Is he very large?
8383,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,"No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-"
8384,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Extraordinary.
8385,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
8386,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
8387,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,What did he do to them?
8388,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,"I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
8389,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,So what did they say?
8390,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,They said it was hard to describe.
8391,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
8392,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
8393,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
8394,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,"He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
8395,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,What makes you say so?
8396,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,His shipboard inventory.
8397,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
8398,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,Former profession.
8399,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
8400,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
8401,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
8402,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,"He's not interested in them, my lord."
8403,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,How do you know?
8404,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Ros,Because I'm one of his girls.
8405,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Varys,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
8406,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Gendry Baratheon,What is this place?
8407,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Thoros,Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
8408,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,You look like a bunch of swineherds.
8409,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Anguy,Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
8410,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
8411,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
8412,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
8413,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,And I won't see them again.
8414,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
8415,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,"Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?"
8416,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
8417,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
8418,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
8419,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,You're fighting for ghosts.
8420,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,"That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down."
8421,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,You found god? Is that it?
8422,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
8423,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,"If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
8424,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Thoros,"You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
8425,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Anguy,"And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
8426,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
8427,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Thoros,House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
8428,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
8429,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Anguy,Murder is a crime.
8430,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,"I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
8431,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Arya Stark,You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
8432,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,"Aye, he was a bleeder."
8433,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,You don't deny killing this boy?
8434,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
8435,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Arya Stark,That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
8436,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
8437,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,"You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
8438,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Sandor Clegane,"So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
8439,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Beric,Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
8440,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Missandei,"The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price."
8441,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Missandei,"And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper."
8442,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,"Is it done, then? They belong to me?"
8443,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,It is done.
8444,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Missandei,It is done.
8445,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,She holds the whip.
8446,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Missandei,You hold the whip.
8447,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,The bitch has her army.
8448,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,Unsullied!
8449,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,Forward march!
8450,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,Halt!
8451,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
8452,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,A dragon is not a slave.
8453,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,You speak Valyrian?
8454,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue."
8455,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,"Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!"
8456,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,I am your master.
8457,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Kraznys,Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
8458,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys.
8459,2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,Daenerys Targaryen,"Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?"
8460,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"Lord, cast your light upon us."
8461,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Men,"Lord of Light, defend us."
8462,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
8463,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Men,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
8464,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,Get back.
8465,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Men,Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
8466,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,Kill him!
8467,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it."
8468,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-"
8469,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,"Arya, don't!"
8470,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,Bring him back from death and darkness
8471,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,No! Let go of me! Let me go!
8472,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sandor Clegane,Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
8473,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,Burn in hell!
8474,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,He will. But not today.
8475,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tormund,Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.
8476,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,"There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
8477,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,How often do these patrols go out?
8478,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
8479,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,You'd like to know that.
8480,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tormund,There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?
8481,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Three.
8482,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,You sure of that?
8483,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,Which three?
8484,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Castle Black.
8485,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,"Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?"
8486,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
8487,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tormund,How many men remain in Castle Black?
8488,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,A thousand.
8489,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,Liar.
8490,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
8491,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,He's no crow.
8492,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Orell,Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
8493,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,I'm not afraid of you.
8494,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tormund,"I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat."
8495,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,A thousand men.
8496,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tormund,We'll find out soon enough.
8497,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,I don't need you to protect me.
8498,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
8499,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Give it back.
8500,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,"Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back."
8501,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Ygritte! Ygritte!
8502,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
8503,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
8504,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Ygritte.
8505,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
8506,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,All of me.
8507,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,We shouldn't.
8508,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,We should.
8509,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,"Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-"
8510,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
8511,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
8512,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,Hmm.
8513,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,You seemed to like it.
8514,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,"Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
8515,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,There's been no one else. Only you.
8516,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,A maid. You were a maid.
8517,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
8518,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,What do you think?
8519,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,Who was he?
8520,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
8521,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jon Snow,"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
8522,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,I'm not done with you yet.
8523,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,How long's it been since you had a bath?
8524,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Ygritte,"Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever."
8525,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sandor Clegane,I want my gold.
8526,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
8527,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sandor Clegane,Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
8528,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Anguy,We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
8529,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sandor Clegane,"Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
8530,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
8531,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Not in the eyes of god.
8532,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,You can't!
8533,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
8534,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,"Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet."
8535,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Man,Riders coming through!
8536,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Man,The Kingslayer.
8537,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Man,Down!
8538,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Locke,"On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."
8539,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,"Pick him up, Locke."
8540,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,You've lost a hand.
8541,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Locke,"No, my lord, he has it here."
8542,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,Take this away.
8543,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Locke,Send it to his father?
8544,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
8545,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,"Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
8546,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,"Thank you, my lord."
8547,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
8548,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Lord Bolton.
8549,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Is there word from the capital?
8550,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
8551,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Roose Bolton,Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
8552,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Will I die?
8553,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Qyburn,No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
8554,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
8555,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Qyburn,"The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
8556,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,I don't need my right hand to kill you.
8557,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Qyburn,I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.
8558,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Mmm.
8559,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Qyburn,"With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
8560,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,No milk of the poppy.
8561,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Qyburn,There will be pain.
8562,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,I'll scream.
8563,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Qyburn,Quite a bit of pain.
8564,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,I'll scream loudly.
8565,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,Lord Baelish.
8566,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,Your Grace.
8567,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
8568,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
8569,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
8570,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
8571,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
8572,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
8573,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
8574,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,I shall do my best.
8575,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
8576,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,I assure you that it will.
8577,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
8578,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Podrick,"Pardon, my lady."
8579,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
8580,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
8581,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
8582,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
8583,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,Naturally.
8584,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
8585,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
8586,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,I understand that.
8587,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,Good.
8588,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
8589,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,And?
8590,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
8591,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
8592,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
8593,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
8594,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
8595,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
8596,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,I would.
8597,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
8598,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
8599,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,My lady-
8600,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
8601,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,Quite sufficient. Thank you.
8602,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olenna Tyrell,"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
8603,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,Give me that.
8604,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,What are you doing?
8605,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
8606,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,Why?
8607,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
8608,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,"Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
8609,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
8610,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,You don't have to do this.
8611,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,I want to. They need good men.
8612,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
8613,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,"What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
8614,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
8615,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,"He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
8616,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,I can be your family.
8617,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Gendry Baratheon,You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.
8618,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Martyn,Willem. Willem!
8619,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Willem,Is this a rescue?
8620,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,Lannister filth! Take him!
8621,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Martyn,"Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-"
8622,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Bring them in.
8623,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
8624,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,"Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
8625,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
8626,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
8627,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,They were boys! Look at them.
8628,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
8629,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
8630,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,"It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
8631,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Leave him.
8632,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
8633,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
8634,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Man,"Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
8635,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
8636,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Man,"Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
8637,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Edmure,Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
8638,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
8639,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Edmure,It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
8640,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
8641,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Catelyn Stark,The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
8642,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,"Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
8643,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
8644,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
8645,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Catelyn Stark,Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
8646,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Edmure,"A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
8647,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,"The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark."
8648,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
8649,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
8650,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,"Kneel, my lord."
8651,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
8652,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Rickard Karstark,Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
8653,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
8654,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
8655,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
8656,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,Don't think of it that way.
8657,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,But it is that way.
8658,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,It is. And it isn't.
8659,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,More is than isn't.
8660,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
8661,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,So why don't you?
8662,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,We need the gold.
8663,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,"Do I frighten you, child?"
8664,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,No.
8665,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
8666,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,I thought he killed you.
8667,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,He did.
8668,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,But how?
8669,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Thoros how many times have you brought me back?
8670,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
8671,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,How many times?
8672,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"Five, I think. No, this makes six."
8673,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Six.
8674,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.
8675,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Then I was stabbed in the belly.
8676,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
8677,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
8678,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
8679,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,And the Hound makes six.
8680,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
8681,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
8682,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,"I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
8683,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
8684,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Thoros,"I don't think it works that way, child."
8685,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Beric,"He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
8686,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Arya Stark,I would. You're alive.
8687,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,"Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors."
8688,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
8689,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,My lady.
8690,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,I meant to come sooner. The battle-
8691,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,"I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything."
8692,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,"Yes, of course."
8693,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
8694,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,I believed that once.
8695,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.
8696,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
8697,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,No.
8698,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
8699,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,You're doing godo s work.
8700,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
8701,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,"I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
8702,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,"Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing."
8703,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,That's not true.
8704,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
8705,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,She's my daughter. I want to see her.
8706,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Selyse,You are a king. You don't need my permission.
8707,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,"Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh"
8708,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,"The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh"
8709,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,Shireen.
8710,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,Father!
8711,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,You've grown since I last saw you.
8712,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
8713,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,No.
8714,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
8715,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,He did. He fought bravely.
8716,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
8717,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,"He won't be visiting, child."
8718,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,Why not? He's my friend. Look.
8719,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
8720,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Stannis Baratheon,Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
8721,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
8722,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,What are you doing here?
8723,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
8724,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Now get out.
8725,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,There's another tub.
8726,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,"This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
8727,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,Why should I care how you die?
8728,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
8729,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
8730,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,Don't you mock me.
8731,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
8732,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,You need trust to have a truce.
8733,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,I trust you.
8734,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
8735,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,Of course.
8736,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
8737,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
8738,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
8739,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
8740,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Brienne,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
8741,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jaime Lannister,Jaime. My name is Jaime.
8742,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
8743,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
8744,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,"Shh, you'll wake Bert."
8745,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,Bert?
8746,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
8747,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
8748,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
8749,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
8750,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
8751,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,Aye. So they did.
8752,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
8753,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
8754,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,Take it. I have more.
8755,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,"My lady, I can't read the words."
8756,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,You can't?
8757,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
8758,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,No. No. No.
8759,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,It's easy. It'll be fun.
8760,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,Go. We can't.
8761,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,"Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
8762,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Davos,I wouldn't know where to start.
8763,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,"At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"
8764,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,It was a bitch of a siege.
8765,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
8766,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,"The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
8767,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
8768,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,"Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
8769,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
8770,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
8771,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,You swore an oath.
8772,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
8773,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,With all my heart.
8774,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Daenerys Targaryen,These are the ones?
8775,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Missandei,"Yes, khaleesi. The officers."
8776,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Daenerys Targaryen,You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
8777,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Daenerys Targaryen,Remove your helmet
8778,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Grey Worm,This one has the honor.
8779,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Daenerys Targaryen,What is your name?
8780,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Grey Worm,Grey Worm.
8781,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Daenerys Targaryen,Grey Worm.
8782,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Missandei,"All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin."
8783,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Daenerys Targaryen,"From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
8784,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Grey Worm,"Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
8785,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,King Robert wanted her dead.
8786,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
8787,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
8788,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,I didn't sit on the small council.
8789,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
8790,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
8791,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
8792,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,"Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
8793,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,Mm-hmm.
8794,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
8795,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
8796,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,Which men do you have in mind?
8797,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
8798,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
8799,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
8800,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,"Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
8801,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
8802,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
8803,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Barristan,"If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
8804,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Jorah Mormont,You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
8805,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,Come to bed.
8806,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,You were right.
8807,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
8808,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,Don't let him.
8809,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
8810,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
8811,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,"Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
8812,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,Give them a new purpose.
8813,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,What?
8814,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,"Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."
8815,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
8816,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,What is it?
8817,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
8818,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
8819,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Talisa,Can you do it?
8820,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Robb Stark,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
8821,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
8822,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Margaery Tyrell,I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
8823,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
8824,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Margaery Tyrell,And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
8825,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Loras,Squire!
8826,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,"Well fought, ser."
8827,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Loras,That was no fight. I don't know you.
8828,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,"Olyver, if it please you."
8829,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,"I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser."
8830,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Loras,How did you know?
8831,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,Know what?
8832,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Loras,That I wanted to.
8833,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Loras,"My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion."
8834,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,"They rarely do, in my experience."
8835,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Loras,"You have a good deal of experience, do you?"
8836,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,With the husbands.
8837,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,That didn't take long.
8838,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Olyvar,"Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed."
8839,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
8840,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
8841,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,What is?
8842,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
8843,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,Is it?
8844,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
8845,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,Many ladies wear it this way.
8846,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
8847,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,You still want me to come with you?
8848,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
8849,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,"Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
8850,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
8851,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,"I do, Lord Baelish."
8852,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,Petyr.
8853,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa Stark,Petyr.
8854,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
8855,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Petyr Baelish,We'll speak again when I return.
8856,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,You're late.
8857,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,What's she doing here?
8858,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,"Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
8859,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
8860,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
8861,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
8862,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
8863,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
8864,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
8865,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,Your jokes are not appreciated.
8866,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,"It wasn't my best, but-"
8867,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
8868,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
8869,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
8870,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
8871,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
8872,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,And how do we do that?
8873,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
8874,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,Wonderful.
8875,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, it is."
8876,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,You can't mean it.
8877,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,I can and I do.
8878,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
8879,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
8880,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,She's a child!
8881,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
8882,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
8883,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,And if I refuse?
8884,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
8885,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tyrion Lannister,I was wed. Or don't you remember?
8886,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,Only too well.
8887,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
8888,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
8889,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,What do you mean?
8890,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,You'll marry Ser Loras.
8891,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,I will not.
8892,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,"The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
8893,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,"No, I won't do it."
8894,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
8895,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
8896,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
8897,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Cersei Lannister,"Father, don't make me do it again, please."
8898,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin Lannister,Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
8899,2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen,"It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay."
8900,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,You've got too much wood in there.
8901,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
8902,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
8903,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,Huh. You know your fires.
8904,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,Someone built your fires for you growing up?
8905,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
8906,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,I knew you were highborn.
8907,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
8908,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,What does it do?
8909,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
8910,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,How much longer?
8911,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,Not so far. A few more days.
8912,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,Is the Wall as big as they say?
8913,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
8914,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,You're playing with me.
8915,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
8916,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,Do you sing?
8917,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"No. No, no, no. Not very well."
8918,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gilly,Sing me a song.
8919,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"Oh, all right. Let's see."
8920,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sam,"Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children."
8921,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,That's not how you skin a rabbit.
8922,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,I know how to skin a rabbit.
8923,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,Not by the looks of it.
8924,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game."
8925,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,I didn't see any game before I got here.
8926,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits."
8927,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,"Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall."
8928,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"You learn how to use your fists, though."
8929,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,"Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?"
8930,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,I had someone else in mind.
8931,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,"Well, someone else is sitting right here."
8932,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
8933,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,Some of us are just a little better.
8934,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,"Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?"
8935,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth."
8936,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,Stop it!
8937,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Hodor,Hodor.
8938,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
8939,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground."
8940,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
8941,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat."
8942,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,"First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace."
8943,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
8944,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,"I said so, didn't I?"
8945,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,Osha!
8946,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,You're a good little hunter.
8947,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,"Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you."
8948,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Osha,Don't push me.
8949,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,Shh. I'm right here with you.
8950,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Rickon,What's happening?
8951,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,I'm right here with you.
8952,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Rickon,What's wrong with him?
8953,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Meera,The visions take their toll.
8954,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,He's having one now?
8955,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jojen,I saw Jon Snow.
8956,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Bran Stark,You saw him? At Castle Black?
8957,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jojen,He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
8958,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tormund,Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
8959,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Orell,Your flock gets smaller every year.
8960,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,You ever climbed it before?
8961,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
8962,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,Aren't you?
8963,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down."
8964,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good."
8965,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,You kill someone for them?
8966,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised."
8967,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
8968,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,Can we not talk about that here?
8969,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls."
8970,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,Did I seem scared the other day?
8971,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,You were trembling like a leaf.
8972,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,Only in the beginning.
8973,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
8974,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,What secret?
8975,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
8976,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
8977,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
8978,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,I won't.
8979,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
8980,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tormund,"Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers."
8981,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
8982,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
8983,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,"Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to."
8984,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,"Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position."
8985,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
8986,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,What?
8987,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
8988,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,But I have to aim.
8989,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,Never aim.
8990,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,Never aim?
8991,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
8992,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,There's someone out there.
8993,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,That's about far enough.
8994,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,We come as friends.
8995,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,"Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
8996,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,Valar morghulis.
8997,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,Valar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
8998,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,You are Thoros of Myr.
8999,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
9000,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,I failed.
9001,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,"You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
9002,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,"You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
9003,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,"My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
9004,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Beric,Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
9005,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,Lucky for the ladies.
9006,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,How many times has the Lord brought him back?
9007,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,Six.
9008,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,That's not possible.
9009,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,The Lord has smiled upon me.
9010,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,You should not have this power.
9011,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,"I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
9012,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,"I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
9013,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,You've been to the other side.
9014,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Beric,"The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
9015,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,You have someone He needs.
9016,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
9017,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gendry Baratheon,"Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
9018,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,I'll get you the steel.
9019,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Man,Come on.
9020,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,I don't like that woman.
9021,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Anguy,That's 'cause you're a girl.
9022,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,What does that have to do with anything?
9023,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Beric,"Forgive me, lad."
9024,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,What are you doing? Let go of him.
9025,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
9026,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Beric,We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
9027,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
9028,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
9029,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Thoros,"We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
9030,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Gendry Baratheon,You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
9031,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
9032,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Arya Stark,You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
9033,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Melisandre,"I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again."
9034,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,"You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
9035,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tormund,Look out!
9036,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ygritte,You all right?
9037,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tormund,"Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
9038,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Sorry. Were you sleeping?
9039,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Wa-
9040,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
9041,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
9042,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Please.
9043,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Please is not a body part.
9044,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,"I'll tell you everything, please."
9045,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
9046,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
9047,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
9048,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,"If I win, you'll let me go?"
9049,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
9050,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
9051,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,The North.
9052,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Too vague.
9053,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Deepwood Motte.
9054,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Terrible guess.
9055,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"Now, where?"
9056,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Last Hearth.
9057,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
9058,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Karhold!
9059,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
9060,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,No. It was just a guess.
9061,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
9062,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Torrhen Karstark.
9063,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
9064,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
9065,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,You swore to tell me if I-
9066,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,You're right.
9067,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
9068,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Yes. You win.
9069,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
9070,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,I'm afraid I am.
9071,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,Everything I told you is a lie.
9072,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,"This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it."
9073,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Theon Greyjoy,"Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
9074,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Ramsay Bolton,I win.
9075,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
9076,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Black Walder,"The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
9077,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Lothar,Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
9078,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
9079,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Black Walder,"As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
9080,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,I don't think that's-
9081,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
9082,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Black Walder,And there's something else.
9083,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
9084,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Black Walder,"Not what, whom."
9085,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,What?
9086,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,No.
9087,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Lothar,Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
9088,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,How old is she?
9089,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Lothar,Nineteen.
9090,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,Could I see her first?
9091,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Black Walder,You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
9092,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Brynden,Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
9093,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Lothar,Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
9094,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Black Walder,And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
9095,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
9096,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,"Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
9097,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
9098,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
9099,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Brynden,Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
9100,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
9101,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Brynden,The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
9102,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
9103,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,"He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
9104,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Catelyn Stark,You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
9105,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
9106,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Brynden,You recall that heroic engagement?
9107,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,I had something less permanent in mind.
9108,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
9109,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Edmure,I'll marry her.
9110,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Robb Stark,"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
9111,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
9112,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Brienne,"Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
9113,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,"When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
9114,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,I should send you back to Robb Stark.
9115,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
9116,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
9117,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
9118,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
9119,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
9120,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
9121,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,He'll make time for you.
9122,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,"As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
9123,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,Shall we drink on it?
9124,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,I don't partake.
9125,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
9126,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
9127,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,"Oh, she won't be going with you."
9128,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Brienne,I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
9129,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,You are charged with abetting treason.
9130,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jaime Lannister,I'm afraid I must insist.
9131,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Roose Bolton,You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
9132,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,Impossible.
9133,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,Why?
9134,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
9135,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
9136,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,Old.
9137,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,Old?
9138,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
9139,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
9140,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
9141,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
9142,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
9143,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,Of course.
9144,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,And you never-
9145,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,No.
9146,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,Not once? Not in any way?
9147,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,Never.
9148,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
9149,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
9150,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
9151,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
9152,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
9153,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
9154,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
9155,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
9156,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
9157,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
9158,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
9159,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,Oh
9160,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
9161,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
9162,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tywin Lannister,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
9163,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Olenna Tyrell,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
9164,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Orell,No!
9165,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Orell,We've gotta cut them loose!
9166,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tormund,No!
9167,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Jon Snow,Take my hand!
9168,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,That's a wonderful pin.
9169,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Loras,"Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
9170,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,I'm very happy about
9171,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Loras,"Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
9172,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,I feel like I'm in a dream.
9173,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Loras,"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
9174,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
9175,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Loras,"It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
9176,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
9177,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,We can have them both killed.
9178,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
9179,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
9180,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,On a boat you built.
9181,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
9182,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
9183,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
9184,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
9185,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
9186,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,What do you want me to say?
9187,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
9188,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
9189,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
9190,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
9191,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
9192,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
9193,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
9194,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Cersei Lannister,Who's going to tell her?
9195,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,Do you think people will like it?
9196,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Shae,I don't think they will even notice it.
9197,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
9198,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Shae,I'm sure he does.
9199,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,Will they let me invite my family?
9200,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Shae,They haven't asked my opinion.
9201,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,But do you think they will?
9202,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Shae,No.
9203,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Maid,"Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-"
9204,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
9205,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
9206,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
9207,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,Of course.
9208,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,"Alone, if I may."
9209,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Shae,Why do you need to speak to her alone?
9210,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
9211,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
9212,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sansa Stark,"It's all right, really."
9213,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Tyrion Lannister,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
9214,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Varys,"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
9215,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
9216,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Varys,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
9217,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
9218,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Varys,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
9219,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
9220,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Varys,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
9221,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
9222,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Varys,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
9223,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
9224,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
9225,2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Petyr Baelish,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
9226,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,How far are we?
9227,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"About a week, I think."
9228,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,You think? You don't know?
9229,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
9230,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
9231,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"Most of the time, yes."
9232,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,How do the men holding the banners fight?
9233,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
9234,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?"
9235,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
9236,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,So what good are they?
9237,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,They help the men march.
9238,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,How?
9239,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
9240,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
9241,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
9242,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
9243,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,"She's right, you don't."
9244,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
9245,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
9246,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
9247,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,"People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
9248,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brynden,That rain will cost us another day.
9249,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
9250,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Catelyn Stark,Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
9251,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brynden,Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
9252,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Catelyn Stark,"Yes, and that is why-"
9253,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brynden,"I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
9254,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,"I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
9255,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Catelyn Stark,Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
9256,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Edmure,He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
9257,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Catelyn Stark,He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
9258,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
9259,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,"If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
9260,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Attack. Attack.
9261,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Who are you writing?
9262,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,My mother.
9263,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Is that Valyrian?
9264,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Gaaa.
9265,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Gaaa? Say hello for me.
9266,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Rytsas.
9267,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Ritsas.
9268,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,That was close enough.
9269,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Does she know her daughter's a queen?
9270,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Not yet.
9271,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,"That will be a surprise, I expect."
9272,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Many surprises for her.
9273,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
9274,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
9275,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,I will.
9276,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
9277,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,"What, now? Are you certain?"
9278,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Are you angry with me?
9279,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Angry? You're my queen.
9280,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
9281,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,Maybe one of each.
9282,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Don't get greedy.
9283,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Talisa,Can you leave the war for one night?
9284,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Robb Stark,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
9285,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tormund,Most men fuck like dogs.
9286,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tormund,"No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on."
9287,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,"You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
9288,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
9289,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,"I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
9290,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"What, you're jealous?"
9291,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
9292,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
9293,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
9294,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
9295,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Don't touch me.
9296,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Orell,You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
9297,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,"Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
9298,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,Come on. Come walk with me.
9299,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother."
9300,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
9301,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
9302,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
9303,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,No.
9304,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,Has he been kind to you?
9305,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,He's tried.
9306,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"You don't want him, though."
9307,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,He's a Lannister.
9308,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
9309,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
9310,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
9311,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
9312,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,If it's the pain you're worried about-
9313,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
9314,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
9315,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
9316,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
9317,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,And that's a good thing?
9318,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
9319,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sansa Stark,How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
9320,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Margaery Tyrell,"Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."
9321,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,She's a child.
9322,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,She's a foot taller than you.
9323,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,A tall child.
9324,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,What's the youngest you've ever had?
9325,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,Not that young.
9326,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,How much older?
9327,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,Older.
9328,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
9329,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,Shae isn't going to like it.
9330,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
9331,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,I should never have told you about that.
9332,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
9333,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
9334,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
9335,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
9336,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bronn,You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
9337,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,Your Grace.
9338,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,Grandfather.
9339,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,You wanted to speak to me?
9340,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
9341,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,"You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
9342,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
9343,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,Of course.
9344,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
9345,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,"I have, yes."
9346,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,May I ask why?
9347,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
9348,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,"So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
9349,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,We could arrange to have you carried.
9350,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
9351,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,Where did you hear about this?
9352,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,Is it true?
9353,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,Apparently so.
9354,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
9355,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
9356,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
9357,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
9358,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
9359,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
9360,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,But I haven't been counseled.
9361,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,You are being counseled at this very moment.
9362,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Joffrey Lannister,I should be consulted about such things.
9363,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tywin Lannister,"From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
9364,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jorah Mormont,Yunkai. The Yellow City.
9365,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Barristan,"The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them."
9366,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jorah Mormont,"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
9367,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
9368,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jorah Mormont,"We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
9369,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
9370,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jorah Mormont,Two hundred thousand if not more.
9371,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
9372,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,"Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
9373,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Missandei,"Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace."
9374,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Missandei,"Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
9375,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,You may approach. Sit.
9376,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Missandei,Will the noble lord take refreshment?
9377,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
9378,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
9379,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,"If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
9380,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
9381,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
9382,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,My ship?
9383,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,"Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
9384,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,And what do you ask in return?
9385,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
9386,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
9387,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,My life?
9388,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
9389,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,"You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends.

9390,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,You swore me safe conduct.
9391,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
9392,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Radzal Mo Eraz,Take the gold.
9393,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
9394,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Barristan,The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
9395,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Daenerys Targaryen,And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?

9402,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,Do I need a ship?
9403,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,What?
9404,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,Am I going somewhere?
9405,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,Of course you're not going anywhere.
9406,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,"So, am I invited to your wedding?"
9407,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
9408,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
9409,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
9410,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
9411,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,I don't have a choice. My father-
9412,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
9413,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
9414,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,And I'm Shae the funny whore.
9415,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
9416,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
9417,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,I swear to you it will not be like that.
9418,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,No? What will it be like?
9419,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
9420,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
9421,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
9422,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,I'm not your lady.
9423,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Tyrion Lannister,You are. You'll always be my lady.
9424,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Shae,"I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing."
9425,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,What happened?
9426,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,Wildfire. I should have been here.
9427,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,"After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started."
9428,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,Do you miss it?

9430,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,Your father's house.
9431,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,Never had a father. Never wanted one.
9432,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
9433,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
9434,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,"Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up."
9435,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,I was born in Flea Bottom.
9436,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,Your blood is noble.
9437,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,"Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-"

9439,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Gendry Baratheon,I'm just a bastard.
9440,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Melisandre,"The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."
9441,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,"Come sit by the fire, child."
9442,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Thoros,"Not talking, eh? That's a first."
9443,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,I don't talk to traitors.
9444,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,I didn't like giving up the boy.
9445,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
9446,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,"The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey."
9447,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,He's not my one true god.
9448,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,No? Who's yours?
9449,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,Death.

9453,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,How far?
9454,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Anguy,Less than a day's ride south.
9455,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Thoros,"What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?"
9456,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Men,Yeah!
9457,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
9458,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Thoros,It will still be west of here two days from now.
9459,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,You swore.
9460,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,"To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first."
9461,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,Why? So you can steal their gold?
9462,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,"I swear to you, this isn't-"
9463,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Arya Stark,"I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
9464,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,"One day you'll understand, but now-"
9465,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Beric,"Anguy, bring her back."
9466,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Man,"Come back, girl!"
9467,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Sandor Clegane,"Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good."
9468,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brienne,I thought you were gone.

9473,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,I owe you a debt.
9474,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brienne,"When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid."

9480,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
9481,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Roose Bolton,"You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?"
9482,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.

9488,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Theon Greyjoy,Where is he?
9489,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,"Who, my lord?"

9491,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Theon Greyjoy,Please.
9492,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,Don't you want us to see it?
9493,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Myranda,"Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it."

9498,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,Oh! There it is.
9499,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
9500,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Myranda,"Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face."
9501,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Theon Greyjoy,Help me. If he comes back-
9502,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,We need to make him feel better.
9503,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Myranda,And how can we make him feel better?
9504,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,I have an idea.
9505,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,"Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls."
9506,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Myranda,Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
9507,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Myranda,"Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy."
9508,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Violet,As good as they say?

9513,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Myranda,I was here first.
9514,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ramsay Bolton,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
9515,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ramsay Bolton,But I was getting jealous.
9516,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ramsay Bolton,Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
9517,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ramsay Bolton,Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
9518,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ramsay Bolton,Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
9519,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Theon Greyjoy,"Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
9520,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ramsay Bolton,This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
9521,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Theon Greyjoy,"No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
9522,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,You're gonna scare it off.
9523,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
9524,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,It's too far away.
9525,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Is that a palace?
9526,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,It's a windmill.
9527,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
9528,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,Just the men who used to live here.
9529,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high."
9530,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,Winterfell has towers three times that size.
9531,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
9532,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
9533,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,What's swooning?
9534,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,Fainting.
9535,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,What's fainting?
9536,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
9537,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
9538,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,Well not all girls are like you.
9539,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow."
9540,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
9541,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
9542,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Would you?
9543,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,So I could tear it off you.
9544,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye."
9545,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
9546,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
9547,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
9548,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,You know nothing-
9549,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
9550,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,And how do you know that?
9551,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
9552,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,Mance is different.
9553,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
9554,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,You don't know that.
9555,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
9556,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,All of us.
9557,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Ygritte,"You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live."
9558,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jon Snow,"Yes, first we'll live."
9559,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
9560,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Hodor,Hodor.
9561,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jojen,That's where we are.
9562,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,What are you telling him?
9563,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bran Stark,"It's all right, Osha."
9564,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
9565,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Meera,Leave him alone.
9566,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,He can speak for himself.
9567,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jojen,I don't fill his head with anything.
9568,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,So what do you talk about?
9569,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jojen,What's happening to him and what that means.
9570,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,"Go on, then. Tell us what it means."
9571,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jojen,It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
9572,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
9573,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jojen,We're not going to Castle Black.
9574,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,What did you say?
9575,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jojen,I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
9576,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,"Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me."
9577,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bran Stark,The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
9578,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
9579,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bran Stark,What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
9580,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,"Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
9581,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Bran Stark,You don't understand. You don't know.
9582,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,"You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
9583,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Osha,"I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."
9584,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,"How is the pain, my lord?"
9585,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
9586,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,"Well, we've stymied the corruption."
9587,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
9588,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,All the good it's done me.
9589,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
9590,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,"Faint praise, my lord."
9591,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
9592,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,"No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
9593,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,What is?
9594,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
9595,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,You performed experiments on living men.
9596,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,On dying men.
9597,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,With their permission?
9598,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
9599,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
9600,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,"How many men have you killed, my lord?"
9601,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,I don't know.
9602,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,Fifty? A hundred?
9603,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,Countless.
9604,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Countless has a nice ring to it.
9605,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,And how many lives have you saved?
9606,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
9607,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
9608,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,A fair offer.
9609,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
9610,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Why not?
9611,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
9612,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,He feels he's being cheated.
9613,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,They'd be fools to kill her.
9614,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Qyburn,"These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
9615,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,We have to return to Harrenhal.
9616,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,Why?
9617,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,I've left something behind.
9618,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
9619,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,And what are those orders?
9620,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
9621,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,You think you'll get a reward.
9622,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
9623,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,"You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
9624,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,I had nothing-
9625,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
9626,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Whoa.
9627,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,"Eyes open, lads."
9628,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Be quiet.
9629,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Men,"The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
9630,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Man,Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
9631,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,"Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
9632,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,A wooden sword?
9633,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,I thought you'd gone.
9634,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,You gave her a wooden sword.
9635,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,We've only got one bear.
9636,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
9637,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
9638,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
9639,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brienne,Ah!
9640,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Get behind me.
9641,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brienne,I will not.
9642,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
9643,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Steelshanks Walton,Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
9644,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,Pull her up.
9645,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brienne,Hold my legs.
9646,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Brienne,Pull him up!
9647,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,The bitch stays.
9648,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
9649,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Locke,She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
9650,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
9651,2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Jaime Lannister,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
9652,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,"I'll give you one try, girl."
9653,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,"Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
9654,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,"Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
9655,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Arya Stark,There's no one worse than you.
9656,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,"Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
9657,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Arya Stark,You're lying.
9658,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,"Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
9659,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Arya Stark,Is that the Blackwater?
9660,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?
9661,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Arya Stark,Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
9662,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
9663,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Arya Stark,But why?
9664,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
9665,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Arya Stark,Why would they be at the Twins?
9666,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sandor Clegane,Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
9667,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Barristan,Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
9668,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
9669,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,You know these men?
9670,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
9671,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Is he more titan or bastard?
9672,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
9673,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,How many?
9674,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Barristan,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
9675,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Enough to make a difference?
9676,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
9677,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,I imagine you're right.
9678,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
9679,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,He may not agree to meet.
9680,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
9681,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Barristan,"Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-"
9682,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,Daario Naharis
9683,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
9684,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,Mind your tongue.
9685,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
9686,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,"You, slave girl, bring wine."
9687,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,We have no slaves here.
9688,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
9689,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
9690,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Barristan,"Under two thousand, Your Grace."
9691,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"We have more, don't we?"
9692,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Barristan,Ten thousand Unsullied.
9693,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
9694,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
9695,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,You're very young to be a captain.
9696,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
9697,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
9698,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
9699,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Jorah Mormont,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
9700,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Or you could fight for me.
9701,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
9702,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,I would pay you as much and more.
9703,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,"Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
9704,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
9705,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
9706,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
9707,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
9708,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Grey Worm,"My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
9709,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
9710,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
9711,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"A barrel, then."
9712,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,"Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
9713,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,I'll come looking for you when this is over.
9714,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
9715,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Barristan,"Gladly, Your Grace."
9716,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,"Half Robert, half lowborn."
9717,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
9718,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,What do you mean to do with him?
9719,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,You know what I mean to do with him.
9720,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
9721,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
9722,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,No.
9723,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
9724,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,You've slaughtered many lambs?
9725,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,And none have seen the blade.
9726,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
9727,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,Your Grace.
9728,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,They feeding you enough?
9729,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
9730,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,You don't belong in a place like this.
9731,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
9732,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,Yeah.
9733,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
9734,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,Melisandre's returned.
9735,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,I didn't know she'd been gone.
9736,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
9737,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,Why?
9738,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,She says there's power in king's blood.
9739,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,She's going to kill him.
9740,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,Sacrifice him.
9741,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
9742,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
9743,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,Because he has your blood in his veins.
9744,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,So did Renly.
9745,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
9746,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
9747,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
9748,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
9749,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
9750,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,You have little regard for your own life.
9751,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Davos,"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
9752,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
9753,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
9754,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,You talk too much.
9755,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
9756,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
9757,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
9758,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
9759,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,"Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
9760,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,"I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
9761,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
9762,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,I fight for beauty.
9763,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,For beauty?
9764,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,We fight for gold.
9765,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
9766,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,You'll die young.
9767,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
9768,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
9769,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,She's well guarded.
9770,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
9771,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Prendahl,Which one of us?
9772,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,"Close your eyes, love."
9773,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Mero,"Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
9774,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
9775,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,You have something for me?
9776,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,Valar morghulis.
9777,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Lady Sansa.
9778,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"You look very handsome, my lord."
9779,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
9780,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
9781,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
9782,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
9783,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"I doubt that very much, my lord."
9784,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
9785,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
9786,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,When I have to.
9787,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, today you have to."
9788,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,"You look radiant, Your Grace."
9789,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,Radiant? Why radiant?
9790,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,It's the word that came to mind.
9791,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
9792,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
9793,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,"A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
9794,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
9795,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,Of course. They play it so often here at court.
9796,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
9797,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,"Not as well as you, I'm sure."
9798,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
9799,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
9800,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Margaery Tyrell,Gone.
9801,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
9802,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
9803,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
9804,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,What are you doing?
9805,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,"Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
9806,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Septon,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
9807,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Could you-
9808,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Thank you.
9809,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Septon,"Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
9810,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,Have you ever seen one like it?
9811,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
9812,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
9813,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
9814,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"Here, taste this."
9815,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,You think I'm trying to poison you?
9816,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,That's good.
9817,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,That's really good.
9818,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,Where do you think it's from?
9819,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,I couldn't even guess.
9820,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
9821,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,"That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
9822,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,There are no mistakes. Not for us.
9823,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
9824,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
9825,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
9826,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
9827,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
9828,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
9829,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,What are you doing?
9830,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,You have to trust me.
9831,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,What-? Get it away. Get it off me.
9832,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,"Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
9833,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,Why are you doing this?
9834,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
9835,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,"No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
9836,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Melisandre,You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
9837,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gendry Baratheon,"Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
9838,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Stannis Baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
9839,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Olenna Tyrell,"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
9840,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
9841,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
9842,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
9843,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,I've got a lifetime for that.
9844,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,Stay.
9845,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,You seem rather drunk.
9846,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
9847,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
9848,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,And?
9849,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
9850,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
9851,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,More than once.
9852,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
9853,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
9854,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Loras,"Well, my father once told me-"
9855,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Cersei Lannister,Nobody cares what your father once told you.
9856,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,"Congratulations, my lady."
9857,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"Thank you, Your Grace."
9858,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,"Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day."
9859,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
9860,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
9861,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
9862,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,Time for the bedding ceremony.
9863,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,There will be no bedding ceremony.
9864,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
9865,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,There will be if I command it.
9866,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
9867,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Joffrey Lannister,What did you say? What did you say?
9868,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
9869,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
9870,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tywin Lannister,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
9871,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
9872,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
9873,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
9874,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"Is that wise, my lord?"
9875,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
9876,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
9877,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Nothing was ever wiser.
9878,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Astoundingly long.
9879,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,What?
9880,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
9881,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,Fourteen.
9882,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
9883,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
9884,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,But your father-
9885,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
9886,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sansa Stark,What if I never want you to?
9887,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,And so my watch begins.
9888,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Ninteen
9889,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Missandei,"Yes, Your Grace."
9890,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
9891,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Missandei,It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
9892,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
9893,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Missandei,Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
9894,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
9895,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Missandei,Athjahakar.
9896,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Athjahaka.
9897,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Missandei,Ath-ja-hakar.
9898,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Athjahakar.
9899,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
9900,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Missandei,"Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
9901,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,No screaming or she dies.
9902,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,What do you want?
9903,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,You.
9904,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Let her go.
9905,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,"Don't scream, lovely girl."
9906,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,You were sent here to kill me?
9907,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,So why haven't you?
9908,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,I don't want to.
9909,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,What do your captains have to say about that?
9910,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,You should ask them.
9911,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Why?
9912,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,We had philosophical differences.
9913,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Over what?
9914,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
9915,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,You're a strange man.
9916,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
9917,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,And this is supposed to impress me?
9918,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,Yes.
9919,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
9920,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
9921,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Will you fight for me?
9922,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daenerys Targaryen,Swear to me.
9923,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Daario,"The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours."
9924,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Tyrion Lannister,You really ought to knock.
9925,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Shae,I brought your breakfast.
9926,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
9927,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,How hard can it be to build a fire?
9928,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
9929,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,He winked at me before.
9930,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,I doubt it.
9931,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,I saw him wink at me.
9932,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,He blinked.
9933,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
9934,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,A what?
9935,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
9936,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,A wink is on purpose.
9937,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
9938,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
9939,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,What? No. This is just the way I talk.
9940,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,I'll build that fire.
9941,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,Don't you think he should have a name?
9942,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,I don't know many boys' names.
9943,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
9944,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Craster.
9945,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
9946,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Mormont.
9947,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
9948,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Why is it a last name?
9949,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
9950,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,"His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
9951,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,"No, Randyll Tarly."
9952,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Randyll is a handsome name.
9953,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,Please don't name him Randyll.
9954,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Is your father cruel like mine?
9955,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,Different manner of cruel.
9956,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,"Not Randyll, then."
9957,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,Don't. Don't go out there.
9958,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,I'll be back. I just want to look.
9959,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
9960,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,It's come for the baby.
9961,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,Stay back!
9962,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Sam,You stay back!
9963,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,"No, you can't have him! No!"
9964,2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,Gilly,No!
9965,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,Are you sure about this?
9966,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,No.
9967,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,It's dangerous.
9968,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
9969,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,Why are you telling me?
9970,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
9971,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
9972,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
9973,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,We have enough men?
9974,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,If Walder Frey cooperates.
9975,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,"If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
9976,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
9977,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
9978,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."
9979,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
9980,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
9981,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls."
9982,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are."
9983,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"This is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra."
9984,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
9985,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care."
9986,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
9987,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Merry,I'm Merry.
9988,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that."
9989,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
9990,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,Very good.
9991,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"There she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you."
9992,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,Still can't see you. Old eyes.
9993,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
9994,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch."
9995,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
9996,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
9997,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"Thank you, my lord."
9998,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us."
9999,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daenerys Targaryen,Where?
10000,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,There.
10001,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
10002,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,Your men but not you?
10003,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.
10004,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside."
10005,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Barristan,We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
10006,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates."
10007,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
10008,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
10009,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
10010,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
10011,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daenerys Targaryen,"Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
10012,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Grey Worm,I trust him.
10013,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daenerys Targaryen,You leave tonight.
10014,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,Very good. We'll prepare.
10015,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Barristan,Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword.
10016,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
10017,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sam Tarly,"We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
10018,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Gilly,How do you know all that?
10019,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sam Tarly,I read about it in a very old book.
10020,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Gilly,You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
10021,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sam Tarly,Yes.
10022,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Gilly,You're like a wizard.
10023,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Gilly,Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.
10024,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
10025,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Pig Farmer,"The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning."
10026,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Need a hand?
10027,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Pig Farmer,Need about eight hands.
10028,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Pig Farmer,Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
10029,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Pig Farmer,Many thanks.
10030,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,Don't! Don't kill him.
10031,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Dead rats don't squeak.
10032,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are."
10033,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,More than anyone you know.
10034,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
10035,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,That so?
10036,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
10037,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,That him?
10038,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,No.
10039,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Good.
10040,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
10041,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.
10042,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,Where are we?
10043,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that."
10044,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
10045,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?
10046,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,Wildlings.
10047,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women."
10048,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
10049,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,That's what Old Nan said.
10050,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,There's a storm coming.
10051,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,I don't see any.
10052,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,It's as good a place to shelter as any.
10053,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.
10054,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,Only one old man and eight good horses.
10055,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,What's one old man doing with eight horses?
10056,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jon Snow,He breeds them for the Watch.
10057,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Ygritte,How's he keep folks from stealing them?
10058,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jon Snow,The Watch protects him.
10059,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,"Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there."
10060,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,And proper steel.
10061,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,Let's carve him up.
10062,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jon Snow,We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
10063,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,I keep telling you.
10064,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Ygritte,He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
10065,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jon Snow,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
10066,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,"I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do."
10067,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.
10068,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jon Snow,Ygritte!
10069,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Clear the barn!
10070,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
10071,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Best part of the animal.
10072,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,"Don't worry, they're still there."
10073,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,I know they're still there.
10074,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
10075,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,I'm not afraid.
10076,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,"Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot."
10077,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
10078,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,"When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
10079,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,"And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
10080,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,That give you some ideas?
10081,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,Might do.
10082,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
10083,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Arya Stark,Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
10084,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
10085,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,How did you get past it?
10086,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
10087,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
10088,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,Some climb straight up the ice.
10089,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
10090,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Hodor,Hodor!
10091,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.
10092,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
10093,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
10094,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,"Well, we'll have to open them up again."
10095,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Old Man,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
10096,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,There's a rider out there.
10097,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Just one?
10098,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,There's more.
10099,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,"It's just thunder, sweet giant."
10100,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Hodor,Hodor.
10101,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Old Man,I yield. I yield.
10102,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Wildlings.
10103,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
10104,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,Hunting.
10105,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,"Shhh, quiet, Hodor."
10106,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Make him shut up. If they hear us…
10107,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"To Hodor] Hush, Hodor. No, no more Hodoring."
10108,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Hodor, calm down."
10109,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,You need to keep quiet.
10110,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,They're gonna hear us.
10111,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Hodor, be quiet."
10112,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Hodor, calm down. Hodor, be quiet!"
10113,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,What did you do?
10114,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,Nothing. I don't know.
10115,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,What's That?
10116,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,That's a horse dying.
10117,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Wildling,Bring them over here.
10118,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Wildling,That was the last of them. The rest are dead.
10119,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,I heard shouting up there.
10120,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Thunder.
10121,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
10122,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Maybe it's ghosts.
10123,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,"That won't help you, grandpa."
10124,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Where you riding?
10125,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Old Man,"Doesn't matter now, does it?"
10126,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,"No, it doesn't matter now."
10127,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
10128,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,You understand.
10129,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Old Man,Let me stand at least.
10130,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Old Man,Let me go with a bit of dignity.
10131,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,Make the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it.
10132,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,The wolves are out there.
10133,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,I can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.
10134,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,"You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood."
10135,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,I can't.
10136,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,"You just did, with him."
10137,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,A wolf is nothing compared to that.
10138,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Old Man,She looks sharp.
10139,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Ygritte,Do it. Do it.
10140,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,Told ya. He's still one of them.
10141,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,"Go on, boy."
10142,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Go on!
10143,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Orell,He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
10144,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Kill him!
10145,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,He's one of them!
10146,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Ygritte,No!
10147,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,Do you hear me?
10148,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Tormund,You're not gonna die for one of them.
10149,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Do it. They'll find us if you don't.
10150,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jon Snow,You were right the whole time.
10151,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"When you hear a songbirdo s whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler, the greatest in the land."
10152,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,Daario Naharis.
10153,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,That one was quick.
10154,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,There may be others.
10155,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
10156,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,That's what you call a few guards?
10157,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Roslin,"Lord Edmure, I hope I'm not a disappointment to you."
10158,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Edmure,"You're a delight to me, my lady."
10159,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Septon,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
10160,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Septon,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words."
10161,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Edmure Roslin,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
10162,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Meera,Is that safe?
10163,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,They're long gone.
10164,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,You were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
10165,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.
10166,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,They can't do that north of the Wall?
10167,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jojen,No one can do that. Anywhere.
10168,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"When I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon."
10169,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,Where?
10170,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.
10171,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,He'll be heading back to Castle Black then. That's where we should go.
10172,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. If this many wildlings got through-"
10173,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,I already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall.
10174,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,Everything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven.
10175,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,"Listen to me, little lord."
10176,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Don't worry, I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon."
10177,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,Me? I'm coming with you.
10178,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.
10179,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you.
10180,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Right now, I have to protect you."
10181,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,"Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell."
10182,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
10183,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.
10184,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,We're not Southerners.
10185,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,And I don't want to leave you.
10186,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,"Shhh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures."
10187,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,You don't have to do any of this.
10188,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,"Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shhh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword."
10189,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Rickon,I know how to swing a sword.
10190,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran Stark,You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.
10191,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,I learned to walk in darkness.
10192,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,"Say your good-byes, little man."
10193,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Osha,Keep this one safe. He means the world to me.
10194,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daenerys Targaryen,"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?"
10195,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Jorah Mormont,It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
10196,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daenerys Targaryen,And Daario Naharis?
10197,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Daario,"The city is yours, my queen."
10198,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,"They're good, aren't they?"
10199,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Lothar,They ought to be because they cost enough.
10200,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Blackfish,Look at the crowd there.
10201,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
10202,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Blackfish,The Godo s love to reward a fool.
10203,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,Uncle.
10204,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Blackfish,"What? He's my nephew, I love him. And he's a damned fool."
10205,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
10206,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Roose,"Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses."
10207,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Blackfish,That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
10208,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Roose,"Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride."
10209,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,I hope she makes you very happy.
10210,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Roose,"Well, she's made me very rich."
10211,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Blackfish,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on."
10212,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
10213,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
10214,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
10215,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,"And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand."
10216,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
10217,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,Striking your king is an act of treason.
10218,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,"No, don't. Don't insult them."
10219,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,Your Grace.
10220,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?"
10221,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Everybody,To bed! To bed! To bed!
10222,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
10223,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Edmure,"Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again ."
10224,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,Poor girl.
10225,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Roose,Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
10226,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,"Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night."
10227,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,That is a very strange custom.
10228,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
10229,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,It seems normal to you?
10230,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
10231,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,"No, but there are other ways of providing proof."
10232,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,Boy or girl?
10233,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,"I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him."
10234,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
10235,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Talisa,Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
10236,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,I do.
10237,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
10238,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Frey Guard,Where are you going?
10239,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,Got salt pork for the feast.
10240,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Frey Guard,The feast is over.
10241,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,It doesn't sound like it's over.
10242,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Frey Guard,"If I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here."
10243,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,"Got pig's feet, too ."
10244,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Frey Guard,Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!
10245,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
10246,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,I've given you meat and wine and music but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
10247,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,Robb!
10248,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Man,"You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?"
10249,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Man,"Feast over yet, is it?"
10250,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Frey Man,"Aye, it's over!"
10251,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Sandor Clegane,It's too late.
10252,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"The King in the North arises, heh heh."
10253,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,"Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance."
10254,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,"You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!"
10255,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,"Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!"
10256,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,And why I would let him do that?
10257,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Catelyn Stark,"On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!"
10258,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Walder,I'll find another.
10259,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Robb Stark,Mother.
10260,2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,Roose,The Lannisters send their regards.
10261,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Man,It's too late.
10262,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Man,Yah! Yah!
10263,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Man,"Go, move out!"
10264,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Men,The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
10265,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Men,The King in the North! The King in the North!
10266,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Man,Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!
10267,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Man,Here comes
10268,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10269,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,What are you doing?
10270,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,I have a list.
10271,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,A list of people you mean to kill?
10272,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
10273,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,You should learn to ignore them.
10274,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
10275,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
10276,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
10277,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,So how should we punish them?
10278,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Who? Whom?
10279,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
10280,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
10281,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,I hear that you're a pervert.
10282,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
10283,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,"We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
10284,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Lady Sansa!
10285,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
10286,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Why sheep shift?
10287,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,That's the vulgar word for dung.
10288,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,My lady-
10289,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sansa Stark,"Well, you asked me."
10290,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Girl,Oh! That's him!
10291,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Podrick,"My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council."
10292,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Killed a few puppies today?
10293,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,"Show him. Come on, show him."
10294,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Pycelle,"Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers."
10295,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10296,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10297,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10298,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10299,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,"Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10300,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10301,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10302,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10303,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10304,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10305,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Pycelle,"Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10306,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,I am the king! I will punish you.
10307,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10308,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10309,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10310,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Come along.
10311,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,I'm not tired.
10312,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10313,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10314,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Joffrey Lannister,I'm not tired!
10315,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Come.
10316,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,Not you.
10317,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10318,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10319,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10320,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,You really think a crown gives you power?
10321,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,No. I think armies give you power.
10322,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,Mm-hmm.
10323,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10324,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10325,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10326,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10327,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
10328,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10329,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10330,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,The Northerners will never forget.
10331,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10332,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10333,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10334,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10335,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,I will not rape her.
10336,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10337,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10338,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10339,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,Does that amuse you?
10340,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10341,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,"Easy for me, is it?"
10342,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10343,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tywin Lannister,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
10344,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Sansa.
10345,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,It's empty.
10346,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,Let's find a place to sleep.
10347,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
10348,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,"Don't, Hodor."
10349,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,Maybe we shouldn't stay.
10350,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,You'd rather be out there?
10351,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
10352,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,I always quite liked the horrible stories.
10353,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,So did I. Once.
10354,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
10355,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,No. Who's he?
10356,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,"Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
10357,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
10358,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
10359,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,"The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun."
10360,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,The Blackfish escaped.
10361,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
10362,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,As you say.
10363,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,"They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
10364,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,You'll be needing a new young girl.
10365,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
10366,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,"And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
10367,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
10368,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
10369,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,"Well, here's to the Young Wolf!"
10370,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,Forever young.
10371,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
10372,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
10373,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,"Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
10374,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.
10375,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Walder Frey,Oh. And?
10376,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Roose Bolton,Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
10377,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,"Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
10378,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
10379,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
10380,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,"Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
10381,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
10382,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,But my father taught me to aim for their head.
10383,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Theon Greyjoy,Kill me.
10384,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,"Sorry, what?"
10385,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,A little louder.
10386,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Theon Greyjoy,Kill me!
10387,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,You're no good to me dead. We need you.
10388,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,"You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
10389,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,Stinking meat.
10390,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
10391,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Theon Greyjoy,Theon Greyjoy.
10392,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,What's your name?
10393,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Theon Greyjoy,Th- Theon Greyjoy.
10394,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Theon Greyjoy,Please.
10395,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ramsay Bolton,What is your name?!
10396,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Theon Greyjoy,Reek. My name is Reek.
10397,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,Hodor.
10398,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,Don't kill me!
10399,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,Who are you?
10400,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,Sam! Sam!
10401,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,Who are you?!
10402,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,Gilly. Don't hurt us.
10403,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,Where are you going?
10404,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
10405,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,"My brother, he's in the Night's-"
10406,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,Shush.
10407,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,Who's your brother?
10408,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,Doesn't matter.
10409,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
10410,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,"No, I'm not."
10411,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
10412,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Hodor,Hodor.
10413,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
10414,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,Take us north of the Wall.
10415,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,What? Why in the world would you want to go-
10416,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,I don't want to. I have to.
10417,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,How did you get through the Wall?
10418,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
10419,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
10420,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
10421,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
10422,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
10423,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
10424,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
10425,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,How do you know all that?
10426,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
10427,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,But you're going to stop them?
10428,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,"Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."
10429,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
10430,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,"On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'"
10431,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,"Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
10432,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,Theon disobeyed my orders.
10433,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,"The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
10434,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Yara Greyjoy,He's your son.
10435,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,Son? He's not a man anymore.
10436,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Yara Greyjoy,He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
10437,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Balon,Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
10438,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Yara Greyjoy,And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
10439,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Yara Greyjoy,I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
10440,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Man,Get those ropes!
10441,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Yara Greyjoy,I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
10442,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,What is it?
10443,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jojen,Dragonglass.
10444,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
10445,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,Why? What are they for?
10446,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,Killing White Walkers.
10447,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,How do you know that?
10448,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
10449,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Meera,But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
10450,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
10451,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,"Take it, Hodor."
10452,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
10453,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Bran Stark,I wish I could. I really do.
10454,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,How are you keeping?
10455,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Great. Never better.
10456,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,It was just a bit of blood.
10457,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,"I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
10458,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,I'm not a highborn.
10459,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,She called you Ser. I heard it.
10460,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
10461,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,"Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
10462,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,I lived below the Street of Flour.
10463,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
10464,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
10465,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Gin Alley.
10466,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
10467,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,"Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
10468,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
10469,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,"You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?"
10470,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
10471,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,So how'd you become a lord?
10472,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Oh, that's a long story."
10473,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,"Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
10474,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
10475,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,You see? Highborns.
10476,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
10477,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Why did you?
10478,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
10479,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Does he?
10480,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,He's dead.
10481,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,How'd he die?
10482,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Following me.
10483,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,When did you come to this strange country?
10484,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,When I was thirteen.
10485,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,You were only a child.
10486,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
10487,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
10488,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
10489,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
10490,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
10491,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,"No, I expect not."
10492,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
10493,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
10494,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,I have a name.
10495,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
10496,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,"What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
10497,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
10498,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,Why do you want me to leave?
10499,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Varys,"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
10500,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,Lord Varys.
10501,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shae,"If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself."
10502,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Keep up.
10503,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Podrick,"I don't think I can, my lord."
10504,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
10505,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Leave.
10506,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
10507,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,She doesn't deserve this.
10508,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
10509,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
10510,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
10511,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
10512,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
10513,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
10514,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
10515,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,So she can have some happiness in her life.
10516,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,You have children. How happy would you say you are?
10517,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
10518,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,Even Joffrey?
10519,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
10520,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,How long does it go on?
10521,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
10522,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Tyrion Lannister,"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
10523,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Cersei Lannister,Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
10524,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,"I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat."
10525,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,"Aye, not for long."
10526,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
10527,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,"I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body."
10528,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,You sewed it on?
10529,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,I did.
10530,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
10531,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,"It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-"
10532,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,What do you want?
10533,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,Mind if I keep warm?
10534,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,Fuck off.
10535,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,But I'm hungry.
10536,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
10537,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,I've got money.
10538,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,What kind of coin is that?
10539,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,It's worth a lot.
10540,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,Sorry.
10541,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,Little shit.
10542,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Frey Soldier,Fool!
10543,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sandor Clegane,Where did you get the knife?
10544,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,From you.
10545,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sandor Clegane,Is that the first man you've killed?
10546,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,The first man.
10547,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sandor Clegane,"Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first."
10548,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Arya Stark,Valar morghulis.
10549,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jon Snow,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
10550,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jon Snow,I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
10551,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
10552,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jon Snow,I do know some things. I know I love you.
10553,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jon Snow,I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
10554,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,I know how this must look. What I meant was-
10555,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,"I swear to you, my lord-"
10556,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,"I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?"
10557,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,Gilly.
10558,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,"Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely."
10559,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,"Yes, my-"
10560,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,Maester.
10561,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,Master.
10562,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,And the child?
10563,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
10564,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,His name is Sam.
10565,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
10566,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
10567,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,"Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall."
10568,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gilly,Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-
10569,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,"Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay."
10570,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,Miles better.
10571,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Maester Aemon,We had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
10572,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-
10573,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,Night.
10574,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
10575,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,I don't know. There just is.
10576,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Well, your father's not going to go to that."
10577,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
10578,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
10579,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,His fangs were as long as bastard swords.
10580,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'"
10581,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,Noblemen.
10582,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-"
10583,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,What is it?
10584,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Shireen,Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
10585,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Stay here. Bar the door.
10586,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
10587,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
10588,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
10589,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."
10590,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
10591,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Aegon Targaryen.
10592,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
10593,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
10594,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,"He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
10595,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-"
10596,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
10597,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
10598,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
10599,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Everything.
10600,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,The boy must die.
10601,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,What are you doing?
10602,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,You're leaving.
10603,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Is this some kind of trick?
10604,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Yes, but not on you."
10605,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater."
10606,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,I know not to drink seawater.
10607,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
10608,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Where should I go?
10609,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
10610,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,The gold cloaks are looking for me.
10611,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
10612,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,No.
10613,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
10614,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,The other way.
10615,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,You ever been in a boat before?
10616,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,You know how to swim?
10617,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Don't fall out. Go on.
10618,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Gendry Baratheon,Why are you doing this?
10619,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
10620,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
10621,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Guard,Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!
10622,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us."
10623,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Pyp,I don't think he can see us.
10624,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jon Snow,Pyp? Sam?
10625,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Sam,"Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
10626,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Man,"Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here."
10627,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jaime Lannister,Cersei.
10628,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,You don't deny it?
10629,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,No. I let him go.
10630,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
10631,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"Aye, I do."
10632,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
10633,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,There has got to be another way.
10634,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
10635,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
10636,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
10637,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."
10638,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,Take him away.
10639,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,Why am I gonna need you?
10640,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,My king.
10641,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us."
10642,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,When did you learn to read?
10643,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
10644,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,"This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him."
10645,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Davos,"You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."
10646,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,I've made my decision.
10647,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Melisandre,He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
10648,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Stannis Baratheon,"You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
10649,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Barristan,"They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready."
10650,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
10651,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Jorah Mormont,You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
10652,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,People learn to love their chains.
10653,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Missandei,"This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom"
10654,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,No.
10655,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,"You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you."
10656,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Man,Mhysa!
10657,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daughter,Mhysa!
10658,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
10659,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,What does it mean?
10660,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Missandei,"It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'."
10661,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
10662,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
10663,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,Fly.
10664,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Daenerys Targaryen,Let me pass
10665,2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,Crowd,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
10666,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Magnificent.
10667,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,Mm-hmm.
10668,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Looks fresh-forged.
10669,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,It is.
10670,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
10671,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
10672,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
10673,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,From someone who no longer had need of it.
10674,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
10675,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,And now we have two.
10676,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Two?
10677,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
10678,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
10679,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,You'll have to train your left hand.
10680,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
10681,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,You'll never be as good.
10682,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
10683,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
10684,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
10685,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
10686,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
10687,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
10688,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Home?
10689,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
10690,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
10691,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
10692,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
10693,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
10694,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,No.
10695,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,No?
10696,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,I don't believe I asked you a question.
10697,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,There's my answer.
10698,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,If you think your bloody honor comes before...
10699,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
10700,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,What do you want?
10701,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Supper would be nice.
10702,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
10703,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,I suppose you want the sword back.
10704,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,Keep it.
10705,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tywin Lannister,A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
10706,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
10707,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Please don't.
10708,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
10709,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
10710,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
10711,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
10712,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
10713,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
10714,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,Oh.
10715,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah, here we are."
10716,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Can you read the sigils?
10717,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,Yellow balls?
10718,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Podrick,"Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave."
10719,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
10720,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,I need a sigil.
10721,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
10722,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Podrick,"I don't see it, my lord."
10723,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
10724,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Dornish Lord,The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
10725,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
10726,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Dornish Lord,Will he?
10727,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,And where is Prince Oberyn?
10728,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Dornish Lord,"Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."
10729,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
10730,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,You must be weary after such a long journey.
10731,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
10732,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
10733,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
10734,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
10735,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
10736,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Look at this one. How lovely is she?
10737,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,Beautiful. But pale.
10738,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
10739,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,You like?
10740,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,Timid. Timid bores me.
10741,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?"
10742,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"I think she likes you. ELLARIA"" She has good taste."
10743,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"You're not timid, are you?"
10744,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,Not timid.
10745,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Do you like women?
10746,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Whore,"When they look like her, my lord."
10747,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,This one will do nicely.
10748,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,"Very good, my lady."
10749,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,"Oh, I'm not a lady."
10750,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,A term of courtesy in this establishment.
10751,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
10752,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,Any of the others?
10753,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,The two girls can leave.
10754,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,You stay.
10755,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,"I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord."
10756,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
10757,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,My lord.
10758,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?"
10759,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
10760,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Take off your clothes.
10761,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,Which way do you like it?
10762,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,My way .
10763,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgan,And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere. And now the rains
10764,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,Oberyn.
10765,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgan,Weep o'er his hall...
10766,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,"Oberyn, don't."
10767,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgan,"With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear."
10768,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgans Friend,"You lost, friend?"
10769,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
10770,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgans Friend,I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
10771,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,We don't like the smell.
10772,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ellaria,"Come with me, lover."
10773,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgan,"Gods, look at this one."
10774,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olyvar,"Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room."
10775,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Morgan,Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
10776,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
10777,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
10778,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist."
10779,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions."
10780,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
10781,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,trouble.
10782,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"Apologies, my love."
10783,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
10784,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister."
10785,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
10786,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,What are you? His hired killer?
10787,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
10788,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,How did that come to pass?
10789,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Bronn,"Killed the right people, I suppose."
10790,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?"
10791,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
10792,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
10793,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
10794,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, they take all kinds."
10795,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Even Dornishmen.
10796,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
10797,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
10798,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
10799,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
10800,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,I was invited to the royal wedding.
10801,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I thought we were speaking truth.
10802,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."
10803,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I wasn't actually present.
10804,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?"
10805,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,I'm asking you a question.
10806,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I've heard rumors.
10807,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
10808,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
10809,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Oberyn Martell,"If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
10810,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jorah Mormont,"They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
10811,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,Ser Barristan.
10812,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Barristan,Your Grace.
10813,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
10814,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Barristan,"Gambling, Your Grace."
10815,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,Gambling?
10816,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Crowd,Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
10817,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,How long have they been at it?
10818,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Missandei,"Since midnight, Your Grace."
10819,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
10820,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
10821,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
10822,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
10823,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
10824,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,You like this girl? Must be frustrating.
10825,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Grey Worm,"You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis."
10826,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,I'd rather have no brains and two balls.
10827,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,You need to eat something.
10828,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,Pigeon pie.
10829,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,"No, thank you."
10830,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,Lemon cakes?
10831,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,You love lemon cakes.
10832,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,Tell her she needs to eat.
10833,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"My lady, you do need to eat."
10834,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,I don't need to eat.
10835,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
10836,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,She needs to eat.
10837,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I can't let you starve.
10838,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I swore to protect you.
10839,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
10840,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,How can you help me?
10841,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"I don't know, but I can try."
10842,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
10843,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
10844,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
10845,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
10846,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
10847,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,"Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
10848,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
10849,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,My lion.
10850,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,What are you doing?
10851,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
10852,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
10853,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
10854,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Of course I haven't forgotten.
10855,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,I want you. Don't you want me?
10856,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Things are a bit tense right now.
10857,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,What things?
10858,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
10859,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,You need to relax.
10860,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,Don't you want to relax?
10861,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,What's wrong?
10862,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,I told you. It's not a good time.
10863,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
10864,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Shae.
10865,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,Do you love her?
10866,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
10867,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,That's not an answer.
10868,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Of course I don't love her.
10869,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,You tried to ship me away.
10870,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Ship you away?
10871,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
10872,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,What in the world are you talking about?
10873,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,"If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!"
10874,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tyrion Lannister,Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
10875,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Shae,You want me to stay?
10876,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Qyburn,"A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent."
10877,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
10878,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
10879,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Days?
10880,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
10881,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Uh... a hook would be more practical.
10882,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"Elegant, I think."
10883,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Thank you for your help with the other matter.
10884,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Qyburn,The symptoms have abated?
10885,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
10886,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Qyburn,"Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can."
10887,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Odd little man.
10888,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
10889,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,What symptoms?
10890,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Symptoms that are not your concern.
10891,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You let him touch you?
10892,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,You jealous?
10893,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
10894,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
10895,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
10896,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
10897,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You drink more than you used to.
10898,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Yes.
10899,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Why?
10900,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
10901,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,It must have been traumatic for you.
10902,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
10903,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,A rather short siege.
10904,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
10905,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Father disowned me today.
10906,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
10907,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You're forgetting Tyrion.
10908,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
10909,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
10910,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Not now.
10911,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
10912,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Something's changed.
10913,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
10914,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,What do you want me to apologize for?
10915,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,For leaving me.
10916,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
10917,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
10918,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
10919,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,You took too long.
10920,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,I... What are you saying?
10921,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,I'm saying you took too long.
10922,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Cersei Lannister,Come in.
10923,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Go away.
10924,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Marei,"Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important."
10925,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
10926,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ygritte,Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
10927,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,We wait for Mance's orders.
10928,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ygritte,"You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back."
10929,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,"And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there."
10930,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ygritte,"Yeah, well, he's a liar."
10931,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,"He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him."
10932,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ygritte,I did.
10933,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,"I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go."
10934,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
10935,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,Mance sent you?
10936,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,How did you find us?
10937,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,"You came from the south, not the north."
10938,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Warg,Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
10939,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
10940,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,Help yourself.
10941,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
10942,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,"Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?"
10943,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,"You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?"
10944,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Tormund,I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
10945,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,She yours?
10946,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ygritte,I'm not anybody's.
10947,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
10948,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,"Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled."
10949,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Styr,"I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow."
10950,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Officer,Draw. Loose.
10951,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
10952,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sam,Sometimes I want to hate you.
10953,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sam,"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
10954,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sam,They're... they're ready for you.
10955,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
10956,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sam,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
10957,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,I've done plenty wrong.
10958,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
10959,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,I didn't murder him.
10960,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
10961,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,He wanted me to kill him.
10962,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slynt,A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
10963,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
10964,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
10965,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
10966,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slynt,The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
10967,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
10968,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slynt,"You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
10969,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,I do.
10970,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slynt,The law is the law. The boy must die.
10971,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Maester Aemon,"If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men."
10972,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
10973,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
10974,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
10975,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
10976,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slynt,Giants?
10977,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
10978,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slunt,"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy."
10979,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
10980,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Janos Slynt,How dare you?!
10981,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
10982,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jon Snow,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
10983,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Maester Aemon,"None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on."
10984,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,"I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon."
10985,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Maester Aemon,"Yes, you are."
10986,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,And I don't trust the bastard.
10987,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Maester Aemon,He told the truth.
10988,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Alliser Thorne,And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
10989,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Maester Aemon,I grew up in King's Landing.
10990,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
10991,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
10992,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Margaery Tyrell,"The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything."
10993,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,Nonsense.
10994,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
10995,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
10996,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Margaery Tyrell,Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
10997,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
10998,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,My word.
10999,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
11000,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
11001,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
11002,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
11003,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Olenna Tyrell,You dare not refuse.
11004,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Margaery Tyrell,A shadow?
11005,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
11006,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Margaery Tyrell,Joffrey is our king now.
11007,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,I meant no offense.
11008,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Margaery Tyrell,And you've given none.
11009,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
11010,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,"Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on."
11011,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
11012,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Meryn,"I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence."
11013,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
11014,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Meryn,The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
11015,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
11016,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
11017,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
11018,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,"I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle."
11019,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
11020,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,Busy getting captured.
11021,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
11022,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,So they say.
11023,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,Ser Jaime Lannister.
11024,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
11025,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,There's still time.
11026,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Joffrey Lannister,Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
11027,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
11028,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,Have you ever been to Meereen?
11029,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Missandei,"Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys."
11030,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,And?
11031,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Missandei,"They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen."
11032,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
11033,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Missandei,"If they're smart, Your Grace."
11034,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
11035,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,"Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy."
11036,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Missandei,Your Grace.
11037,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
11038,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,A dusk rose.
11039,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
11040,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,And this one's called lady's lace.
11041,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,Would you like to walk without shoes?
11042,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,"You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy."
11043,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
11044,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
11045,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daario,Your Grace.
11046,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jorah Mormont,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
11047,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
11048,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Barristan,"163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this."
11049,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Daenerys Targaryen,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
11050,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,There she is.
11051,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, there she is."
11052,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,And? You made a promise.
11053,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
11054,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,To keep them safe.
11055,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
11056,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,A complication does not release you from a vow.
11057,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
11058,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Brienne,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
11059,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Jaime Lannister,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
11060,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
11061,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,You're drunk.
11062,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
11063,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
11064,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,"I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you."
11065,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,Anyone would have done the same.
11066,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,"But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life."
11067,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,"It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me."
11068,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
11069,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
11070,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sansa Stark,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
11071,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Ser Dontos,Yeah.
11072,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,When am I going to get a horse of my own?
11073,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,The little lady wants a pony.
11074,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,The little lady wants away from your stench.
11075,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,"Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?"
11076,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
11077,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,No.
11078,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,"You're not very smart, are you?"
11079,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,I'm not a thief.
11080,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
11081,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,A man's got to have a code.
11082,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
11083,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,"You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
11084,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,I'm hungry. You're hungry.
11085,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,"Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach."
11086,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
11087,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,He killed Lommy.
11088,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,What the fuck's a Lommy?
11089,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
11090,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Got what?
11091,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,My sword Needle.
11092,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Needle? Of course you named your sword.
11093,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,Lots of people name their swords.
11094,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Lots of cunts.
11095,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,What are you... get back here.
11096,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,My brother gave me that sword.
11097,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Get back here.
11098,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,He killed my friend.
11099,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
11100,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Man,"Come on, give it up."
11101,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Man,Come here.
11102,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Man,Let's have a feel there.
11103,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Man,Leave it.
11104,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Innkeeper,"Please, she's a good girl."
11105,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
11106,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,I know you.
11107,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,You're the Hound.
11108,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
11109,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
11110,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,Just keeping the king's peace.
11111,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,No need. The war's over.
11112,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
11113,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,None taken.
11114,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,"He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?"
11115,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,"But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
11116,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,She's all right. I've had better.
11117,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,"You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
11118,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,I'm not going to King's Landing.
11119,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
11120,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Fuck the king.
11121,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,"When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are."
11122,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
11123,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,You got money to pay for it?
11124,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,You paid for it?
11125,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,"No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
11126,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Not a penny.
11127,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,I'll still take that chicken.
11128,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
11129,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
11130,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
11131,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,You don't seem to understand the situation.
11132,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,"I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
11133,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
11134,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Sandor Clegane,Someone is.
11135,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
11136,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,What? What do you mean?
11137,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
11138,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Polliver,Carry me?
11139,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,Fine little blade.
11140,2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,Arya Stark,Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
11141,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
11142,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Tansy! Tansy!
11143,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,There you are.
11144,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Myranda,"I can't see her, Ramsay."
11145,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Tansy!
11146,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!"
11147,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Tansy.
11148,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Myranda,Where is she?
11149,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!"
11150,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too."
11151,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Myranda,I only wounded her.
11152,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?"
11153,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Theon Greyjoy,"A fine shot, master. My lady."
11154,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tansy,"Please, my lord. It hurts."
11155,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon."
11156,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Myranda,She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
11157,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work."
11158,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tansy,Why? I did whatever you asked.
11159,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,But you made Myranda feel jealous.
11160,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Myranda,Me jealous of her?
11161,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tansy,"My lord, please."
11162,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
11163,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
11164,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Not so pretty now.
11165,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
11166,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Podrick,Is it solid gold?
11167,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Gilded steel.
11168,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
11169,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,I'm not hungry.
11170,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
11171,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
11172,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Oh!
11173,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Podrick,I'll clean it up.
11174,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"No, I'll do it. Leave us."
11175,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,It's only wine.
11176,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,I can't fight anymore.
11177,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,What about your left?
11178,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
11179,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
11180,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
11181,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
11182,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
11183,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
11184,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
11185,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
11186,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Is this place safe?
11187,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
11188,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Uh-huh.
11189,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
11190,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
11191,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
11192,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
11193,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
11194,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,Best time to attack a man.
11195,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
11196,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,Plan on growing it back?
11197,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"Come on, then."
11198,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Man,Open the gates!
11199,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Man,Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!
11200,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Father. Welcome home.
11201,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,"Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard."
11202,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"A pleasure, Mother."
11203,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Walda,Hello.
11204,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,"See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
11205,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Woman,"This way, my lady."
11206,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,Where is your prize?
11207,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
11208,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
11209,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Locke,Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
11210,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Father.
11211,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,What did you do to him?
11212,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
11213,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,You flayed him.
11214,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
11215,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
11216,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.
11217,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,"My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
11218,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-
11219,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
11220,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
11221,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
11222,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
11223,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,I placed far too much trust in you.
11224,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
11225,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm sorry, my lord."
11226,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,Give him the razor.
11227,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
11228,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
11229,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
11230,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Theon Greyjoy,"I don't know, my lord."
11231,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
11232,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
11233,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Theon Greyjoy,"No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
11234,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,And crisped them so no one would know.
11235,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes, my lord."
11236,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
11237,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
11238,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,You ready for a hunt?
11239,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Meryn Trant,Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.
11240,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Locke,Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
11241,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Theon Greyjoy,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
11242,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Locke,Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
11243,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
11244,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ramsay Bolton,"Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
11245,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Roose,"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
11246,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
11247,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Varys,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
11248,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, to be foreign."
11249,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Varys,Ahem.
11250,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Varys,Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
11251,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
11252,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Varys,"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
11253,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
11254,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Varys,No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
11255,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
11256,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Varys,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
11257,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Mace,"From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup."
11258,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Mace,May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
11259,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"
11260,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Mace,"I shall be honored, Your Grace."
11261,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
11262,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
11263,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,A book?
11264,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
11265,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle."
11266,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
11267,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,"Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
11268,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,So they say.
11269,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
11270,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Man,Stormbringer.
11271,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Man,Terminus.

11273,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Man,Wolfsbane.
11274,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again."
11275,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Don't.
11276,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,"You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?"
11277,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Don't call me that.
11278,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,What should I call you?
11279,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
11280,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,Our friendship?
11281,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
11282,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,What?
11283,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
11284,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,What is this?
11285,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
11286,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,She doesn't want you.
11287,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,I need to do right by her.
11288,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,You don't want her.
11289,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,By our children.
11290,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,What are you afraid of?
11291,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,I'm not afraid.
11292,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?
11293,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,I need you to leave.
11294,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
11295,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Shae.
11296,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,"We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
11297,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
11298,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shae,How many whores have you been with?
11299,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
11300,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
11301,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
11302,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Axell Florent,"Sire, I served you well."
11303,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"Lord of Light, show us the way..."
11304,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Axell Florent,"Selyse, you're my sister!"
11305,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,Yours are the stars that guide us.
11306,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Axell Florent,Tell him! Tell him!
11307,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
11308,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
11309,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Davos,Lord Florent was your brother by law.
11310,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,He was an infidel.
11311,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Davos,"He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
11312,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
11313,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Davos,How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
11314,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,A good deal more than you.
11315,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,"Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
11316,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Davos,"I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
11317,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,Meat's off.
11318,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,Our larders are almost empty.
11319,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,"Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
11320,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,You hate fish.
11321,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
11322,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,"When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
11323,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,Of course I remember.
11324,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,"Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
11325,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,It's all I knew when I was a child.
11326,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,Until you found the Lord of Light?
11327,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,Until he found me.
11328,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,I fear for our daughter's soul.
11329,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.
11330,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,She's a stubborn little beast.
11331,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,She's a child.
11332,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
11333,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Baratheon,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
11334,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Selyse,As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
11335,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,Come in.
11336,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"Were you sleeping, Princess?"
11337,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
11338,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,I heard it.
11339,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,And it frightened you?
11340,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
11341,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
11342,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,But they screamed.
11343,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
11344,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
11345,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
11346,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,And you didn't have this.
11347,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
11348,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,"I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
11349,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
11350,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Shireen,There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
11351,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Melisandre,"There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
11352,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Hodor,Hodor.
11353,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bran Stark,Why did you wake me?
11354,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Meera,You've been gone for hours.
11355,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bran Stark,I was hungry.
11356,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Meera,We're all hungry.
11357,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bran Stark,I was just eating.
11358,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jojen,"Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
11359,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jojen,"Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
11360,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Meera,"You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
11361,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bran Stark,"Hodor, take me to the tree."
11362,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Threeeyed Raven,Look for me... beneath the tree.
11363,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,He saw us.
11364,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Threeeyed Raven,North.
11365,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bran Stark,I know where we have to go.
11366,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Septon,"Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder."
11367,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"With this kiss, I pledge my love."
11368,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Sansa Stark,We have a new queen.
11369,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Better her than you.
11370,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
11371,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,It feels proportionate.
11372,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,Proportionate to what?
11373,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,The expected extravagance.
11374,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
11375,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
11376,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
11377,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
11378,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
11379,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
11380,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
11381,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
11382,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,All taken care of.
11383,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,You saw her board the ship?
11384,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"Aye, she's on it."
11385,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,You saw the ship sail away?
11386,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
11387,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,How do you know?
11388,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
11389,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,There's someone following you?
11390,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Bronn,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
11391,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,Hello.
11392,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Hello.
11393,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,Not you.
11394,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
11395,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,My lady. My lady.
11396,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
11397,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Musician,"A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord..."
11398,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,Very good. Very good. Off you go.
11399,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,"My love, why don't we make the announcement?"
11400,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
11401,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,"We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
11402,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,You're an example to us all.
11403,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Loras,"Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry."
11404,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
11405,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Loras,As does yours.
11406,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"So, looking forward to your wedding?"
11407,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Loras,"Yes, very much."
11408,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
11409,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Loras,They certainly are.
11410,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
11411,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Loras,And neither will you.
11412,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,Your Grace. My king. My queen.
11413,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
11414,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,"I'm no lady, Your Grace."
11415,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Did you just bow?
11416,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
11417,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
11418,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,"That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
11419,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
11420,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
11421,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Yes, yes."
11422,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
11423,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
11424,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,"As you say, Your Grace."
11425,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
11426,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
11427,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
11428,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
11429,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
11430,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
11431,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,But you love him.
11432,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Brienne,Your Grace.
11433,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,"No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
11434,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,She'll do no such thing.
11435,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,"Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
11436,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
11437,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Maid,Your Grace.
11438,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
11439,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
11440,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,"Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
11441,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
11442,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,I never meant to annoy anyone.
11443,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
11444,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Pycelle,"Your Grace, Queen Margaery-"
11445,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
11446,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
11447,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,You're in rather a good mood.
11448,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,I suppose I am.
11449,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,I won't ask why.
11450,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Small pleasures.
11451,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
11452,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,Prince Oberyn.
11453,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,"I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
11454,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ellaria,My lord. My lady.
11455,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,Charmed.
11456,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
11457,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ellaria,"We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
11458,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,"Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
11459,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,No? How tolerant of you.
11460,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,"I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
11461,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
11462,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
11463,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
11464,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tywin Lannister,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
11465,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Oberyn Martell,"People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
11466,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
11467,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
11468,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Renly Dwarf,I'm the rightful king.
11469,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Robb Dwarf,King in the North!
11470,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,Yes!
11471,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Balon Dwarf,Traitor. You're a traitor.
11472,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,For the Seven Kingdoms!
11473,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,Let the war begin.
11474,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Dwarf,"Renly, you're no king."
11475,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Balon Dwarf,"Away, degenerate. Away. Away."
11476,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Renly Dwarf,"Ooh, careful."
11477,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Dwarf,Go on.
11478,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Renly Dwarf,I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
11479,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Balon Dwarf,"Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
11480,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Robb Dwarf,I am the rightful king.
11481,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Balon Dwarf,"Challenge me, ruffian."
11482,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Robb Dwarf,Take that.
11483,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Balon Dwarf,I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
11484,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Robb Dwarf,I am the King in the North!
11485,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Stannis Dwarf,Not wildfire!
11486,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
11487,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Podrick,"Yes, my lord."
11488,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
11489,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,Charge!
11490,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,"Ready, again."
11491,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Robb Dwarf,I am the King in the North! - Charge!
11492,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,Charge! Yes!
11493,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,Your head!
11494,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Dwarf,Fine gentlemen.
11495,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
11496,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
11497,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
11498,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,It did not spill.
11499,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,"My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
11500,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
11501,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Your Grace does me a great honor.
11502,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,It's not meant as an honor.
11503,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,Bring me my goblet.
11504,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
11505,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,Kneel. Kneel before your king.
11506,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,Kneel. I said... kneel!
11507,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,"Look, the pie."
11508,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,My queen.
11509,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
11510,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Sansa Stark,Can we leave now?
11511,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Let's find out.
11512,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"
11513,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
11514,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
11515,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Well, hurry up. This pie is dry."
11516,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"Mm, good. Needs washing down."
11517,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
11518,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,"No. No, you'll wait here... un..."
11519,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion Lannister,Your Grace?
11520,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Joffrey Lannister,It's nothing.
11521,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Margaery Tyrell,He's choking!
11522,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,Help the poor boy.
11523,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Olenna Tyrell,"Idiots, help your king."
11524,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Move away!
11525,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Jaime Lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
11526,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Help him! Someone help him!
11527,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Joffrey!
11528,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ser Dontos,Come with me now.
11529,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
11530,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Ser Dontos,"If you want to live, we have to leave."
11531,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,Don't touch him!
11532,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
11533,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,My son.
11534,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Man,He's gone. Our king is gone.
11535,2014-04-13,Season 4,Episode 2,The Lion and the Rose,Cersei Lannister,"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
11536,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,You did this. You did this!
11537,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,We have to leave.
11538,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Take him! Take him!
11539,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
11540,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
11541,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Where is she?!
11542,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,No one leaves the capital! No one!
11543,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,Get in.
11544,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,Where are we going?
11545,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,Somewhere safe.
11546,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,"Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
11547,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,Lord Baelish?
11548,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
11549,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
11550,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
11551,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
11552,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,"I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
11553,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,"10,000."
11554,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ser Dontos,Wait!
11555,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
11556,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,I didn't murder anyone.
11557,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
11558,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,Why did you kill him?
11559,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
11560,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,He saved me.
11561,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
11562,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,He was helping me because I saved his life.
11563,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
11564,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
11565,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sansa Stark,We're all liars here.
11566,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Petyr Baelish,"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
11567,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Margaery Tyrell,So am I the queen?
11568,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olenna Tyrell,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
11569,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Margaery Tyrell,"Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
11570,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olenna Tyrell,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
11571,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Margaery Tyrell,What was it like?
11572,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olenna Tyrell,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
11573,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Margaery Tyrell,One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
11574,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olenna Tyrell,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
11575,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Margaery Tyrell,But I would have been the queen.
11576,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olenna Tyrell,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
11577,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
11578,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,I'm not trying to trick you.
11579,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,It means I'll become king.
11580,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
11581,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,A good king?
11582,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
11583,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,This is hardly the place or the time.
11584,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,Holiness?
11585,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
11586,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,Justice.
11587,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
11588,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,No.
11589,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,No.
11590,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,What about strength?
11591,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
11592,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,Wisdom.
11593,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Yes!
11594,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,Wisdom is what makes a good king.
11595,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
11596,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
11597,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,A king needs a queen.
11598,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
11599,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,Yes.
11600,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
11601,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
11602,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,How are you?
11603,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tommen Lannister,I'm all right.
11604,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
11605,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
11606,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Septon,"Yes, my lord. All of you."
11607,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
11608,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,I don't know what I saw.
11609,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
11610,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
11611,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
11612,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
11613,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
11614,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
11615,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,No.
11616,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Stop it. Stop.
11617,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Stop. Stop. It's not right.
11618,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,It's not right. It's not right.
11619,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jaime Lannister,I don't care.
11620,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,Don't.
11621,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Cersei Lannister,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
11622,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
11623,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,"Near Fairmarket, I think."
11624,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,You think? You don't have a map?
11625,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,"No, I don't have a map."
11626,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,Maybe we should get one.
11627,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
11628,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,How far is it to the Eyrie?
11629,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Far.
11630,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,And you're sure we're going the right way?
11631,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,"Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way."
11632,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,On your way where?
11633,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,"Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me."
11634,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
11635,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Why Braavos?
11636,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,I have friends there.
11637,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,I doubt it.
11638,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,Seven blessings to you.
11639,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,What do you want?
11640,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,What do I want? This is my land.
11641,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land."
11642,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
11643,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,He's never been the same.
11644,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,Which house did he fight for?
11645,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,The Tullys of Riverrun.
11646,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,"There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it."
11647,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
11648,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
11649,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,Father!
11650,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
11651,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
11652,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,I'm so sorry.
11653,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,Really good.
11654,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,Did you fight at the Twins?
11655,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
11656,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
11657,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Guest right don't mean much anymore.
11658,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,"It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
11659,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,You got any ale?
11660,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,Afraid not.
11661,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,How can a man not keep ale in his home?
11662,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Farmer Hamlet,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
11663,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
11664,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Fair wages for fair work.
11665,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,What did you do?!
11666,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,Get your horse saddled.
11667,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,You told me you weren't a thief.
11668,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,I wasn't.
11669,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,He took us in. He fed us and you...
11670,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,"Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
11671,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,You don't know that.
11672,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
11673,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Arya Stark,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
11674,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sandor Clegane,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
11675,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ranger,Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
11676,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorne,"There he is, Sam the Slayer."
11677,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Janos Slynt,Going to visit your wildling whore?
11678,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,She's not a whore.
11679,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Janos Slynt,No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
11680,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,They all think I'm lying.
11681,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,About what?
11682,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,Killing the white Walker.
11683,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
11684,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
11685,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,A what?
11686,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"Well, a wildling."
11687,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,My father hated that word.
11688,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
11689,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,"I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?"
11690,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
11691,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
11692,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
11693,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,Why do you worry about it?
11694,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"100 men, one woman."
11695,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,They've got other things to think about.
11696,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,That's the only thing they think about.
11697,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,You're being silly.
11698,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
11699,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,What about you?
11700,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
11701,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,Thank you.
11702,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,For what?
11703,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,For worrying about me.
11704,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
11705,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,So what are you saying?
11706,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
11707,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,Are you bored of me?
11708,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
11709,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
11710,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,Your Grace.
11711,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
11712,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,Joffrey?
11713,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
11714,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
11715,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,What progress have you made?
11716,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
11717,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,House Peasebury.
11718,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,House Musgood.
11719,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,House Musgood.
11720,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,And House Haigh.
11721,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
11722,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
11723,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,The Golden Company?
11724,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,They've never broken a contract.
11725,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,They're sellswords.
11726,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
11727,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,We don't have any gold.
11728,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,Not yet.
11729,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Stannis Baratheon,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
11730,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,You're late.
11731,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"I'm sorry, Princess."
11732,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,I thought you weren't coming.
11733,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
11734,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,"You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say ""ka-nigit."""
11735,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
11736,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
11737,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
11738,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.
11739,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,Thank you very much.
11740,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
11741,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
11742,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,What's the difference?
11743,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
11744,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,My father says a criminal is a criminal.
11745,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
11746,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,You've sailed to Braavos?
11747,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
11748,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,What was that for?
11749,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,I need you to write a message.
11750,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
11751,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
11752,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
11753,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Shireen,But that's not you.
11754,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Davos,I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
11755,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
11756,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Whore,Precious little thing.
11757,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Whore,What's his name?
11758,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,Sam.
11759,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Whore,Lovely. That the daddy?
11760,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,No.
11761,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Whore,Where's the daddy?
11762,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,He's dead.
11763,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Whore,Oh. Where you from?
11764,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,North of here.
11765,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Whore,North of here? You a fucking wildling?
11766,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Madam,Only room and board?
11767,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
11768,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Madam,"Could find other work for her, too."
11769,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,No other work.
11770,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Moles Town Madam,There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
11771,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
11772,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,You protected me north of the Wall.
11773,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
11774,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,You have to trust me. It's for the best.
11775,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Gilly,Best for you.
11776,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Sam,"Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
11777,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Greedy.
11778,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ellaria,No?
11779,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olyvar,"I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste."
11780,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
11781,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ellaria,"That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you."
11782,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Your loss.
11783,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olyvar,You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
11784,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Does that surprise you?
11785,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olyvar,Everyone has a preference.
11786,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides."
11787,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olyvar,I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
11788,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"What are you, 25?"
11789,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ellaria,Children.
11790,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day."
11791,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olyvar,Did you?
11792,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ellaria,He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
11793,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,They will all have to line up behind you.
11794,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Prince Oberyn.
11795,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Lord Tywin.
11796,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,May we have the room?
11797,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ellaria,"Call my name if you need me, lover."
11798,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Would you like to sit?
11799,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"No, thank you."
11800,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Some wine?
11801,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,I'm sorry about your grandson.
11802,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Are you?
11803,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
11804,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Which way is that?
11805,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?"
11806,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Some believe the king choked.
11807,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
11808,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
11809,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,I did. This is why I know.
11810,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
11811,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
11812,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
11813,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,You think we conspired together?
11814,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,What did you discuss?
11815,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,The death of my sister.
11816,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,For which you blame me.
11817,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
11818,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
11819,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow."
11820,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
11821,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
11822,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,Categorically.
11823,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,I would like to speak with the Mountain.
11824,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
11825,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
11826,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,I could arrange for this meeting.
11827,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,But you want something in return.
11828,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
11829,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,Why?
11830,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
11831,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting."
11832,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
11833,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,"I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin."
11834,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
11835,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Oberyn Martell,You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
11836,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin Lannister,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
11837,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
11838,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me."
11839,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,A noble effort.
11840,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese."
11841,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
11842,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I've heard nothing, my lord."
11843,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
11844,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
11845,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
11846,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"No, my lord. You didn't?"
11847,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
11848,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,Your father.
11849,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Of course.
11850,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,Mace Tyrell.
11851,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
11852,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
11853,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
11854,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
11855,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
11856,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"My lord, she's gone."
11857,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Gone?
11858,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
11859,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
11860,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"Yes, my lord?"
11861,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,They'll be following you now.
11862,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,Who will?
11863,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
11864,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"Any other witnesses, my lord?"
11865,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
11866,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
11867,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
11868,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
11869,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Why not?
11870,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
11871,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
11872,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I'll ask, my lord."
11873,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
11874,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
11875,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
11876,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Are you going to accept their offer?
11877,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,My lord.
11878,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
11879,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"You've been good to me, my lord."
11880,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
11881,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"I already gave them an answer, my lord."
11882,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
11883,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
11884,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Podrick,"Farewell, my lord."
11885,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Tyrion Lannister,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
11886,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olly,Mother says it's time to eat.
11887,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Guymon,What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
11888,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olly,Potatoes.
11889,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Guymon,"Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got..."
11890,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Man,The wildlings!
11891,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Ollys Mother,Guymon! Hide. Hide!
11892,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Styr,You know how to get to Castle Black?
11893,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Olly,Yes. Yes.
11894,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Styr,Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
11895,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Yarwyck,We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
11896,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Men,Aye! Aye!
11897,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Yarwyck,Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
11898,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Men,Aye!
11899,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorne,"If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time."
11900,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Maester Aemon,We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
11901,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Pyp,There's got to be a way to protect them.
11902,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorne,"You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?"
11903,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jon Snow,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
11904,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorne,We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
11905,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Pyp,Rangers returning.
11906,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jon Snow,Help him.
11907,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Dolorous Edd,Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
11908,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorn,What took you so long?
11909,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Grenn,We were held up.
11910,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorn,By what?
11911,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Grenn,Chains.
11912,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Dolorous Edd,We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
11913,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jon Snow,And the mutineers stayed?
11914,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Dolorous Edd,They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
11915,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jon Snow,We need to ride north and kill them all.
11916,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Alliser Thorn,"We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
11917,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jon Snow,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
11918,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Pyp,I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
11919,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,Are they attacking?
11920,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jorah Mormont,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
11921,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,What is he doing?
11922,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Barristan Selmy,I believe he means to...
11923,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Missandei,"He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole."
11924,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Barristan Selmy,"Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words."
11925,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jorah Mormont,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
11926,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
11927,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Grey Worm,"Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you."
11928,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
11929,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Barristan Selmy,"Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive."
11930,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,Which is why you must remain by my side.
11931,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Jorah Mormont,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
11932,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
11933,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daario,"I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you."
11934,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
11935,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Missandei,"He is very brave, Your Grace."
11936,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
11937,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,You sure you don't want a horse?
11938,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daario,Why would I want a horse?
11939,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,Horses are faster than men.
11940,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daario,Horses are dumber than men.
11941,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,I am Daenerys Stormborn.
11942,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,"Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
11943,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
11944,2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,Daenerys Targaryen,Fire!
11945,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,"My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer ""Ills."""
11946,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,Isles. Summer Isles.
11947,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,Summer Isles.
11948,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,I am from an island called Naath.
11949,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,When they took you?
11950,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,"When did they take me?"" I was five years old."
11951,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,You remember your home?
11952,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
11953,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,"Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing."
11954,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
11955,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,I don't want return.
11956,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,Kill the masters.
11957,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,Kill the masters.
11958,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Daenerys Targaryen,How are the lessons coming?
11959,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Missandei,"Very well, Your Grace."
11960,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,"Missandei is teacher good, my queen."
11961,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Daenerys Targaryen,You'll have to continue later. It's time.
11962,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Mossador,You heard her! She said she came to free us.
11963,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Elder Meereen Slave,You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
11964,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Mossador,She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
11965,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Mossador,She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
11966,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meereen Slave,I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
11967,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Elder Meereen Slave,"I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way"
11968,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,All men must die.
11969,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,"But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains."
11970,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Elder Meereen Slave,Who are you?
11971,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,"This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains."
11972,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Elder Meereen Slave,You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
11973,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meereen Slave,"We have no training, weapons."
11974,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grey Worm,"There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it."
11975,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
11976,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
11977,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Slaves,Mhysa! Mhysa!
11978,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Daenerys Targaryen,"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
11979,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jorah Mormont,"163, Khaleesi."
11980,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, that was it."
11981,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Barristan Selmy,"Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy."
11982,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Daenerys Targaryen,I will answer injustice with justice.
11983,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,What the hell was that?
11984,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
11985,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
11986,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
11987,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,You talk to my brother this way?
11988,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,All the time. He got used to it.
11989,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Do you think he did it?
11990,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
11991,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
11992,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,We're done for today.
11993,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
11994,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
11995,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
11996,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
11997,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
11998,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
11999,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
12000,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
12001,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,Her son?
12002,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Don't. You know what's coming?
12003,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
12004,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
12005,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
12006,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Depends. Did you do it?
12007,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
12008,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
12009,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, you could set me free."
12010,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,You know I can't.
12011,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,Then there's really nothing else to say.
12012,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
12013,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
12014,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
12015,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,Except I didn't do it.
12016,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
12017,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
12018,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
12019,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tyrion Lannister,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
12020,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,Where are you taking me?
12021,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
12022,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,Did you kill Joffrey?
12023,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
12024,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,I know it was you.
12025,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
12026,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
12027,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,Why not?
12028,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
12029,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,Then perhaps it was your husband.
12030,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,No.
12031,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,How do you know?
12032,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,I just do.
12033,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
12034,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
12035,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
12036,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
12037,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
12038,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,And what do you want?
12039,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
12040,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sansa Stark,Who could trust you?
12041,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Petyr Baelish,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
12042,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
12043,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
12044,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
12045,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
12046,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
12047,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,How absentminded of me.
12048,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,Mm-hmm.
12049,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
12050,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
12051,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"Well, he could have done."
12052,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,"He could have done,but he didn't."
12053,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"You don't know, Grandmother."
12054,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
12055,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,What? I don't understand.
12056,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tyrell,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
12057,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Bring it through! And again.
12058,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Very nice. Good.
12059,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
12060,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Let's see what you can do.
12061,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"Olly, you just watch for now."
12062,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olly,I can fight.
12063,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
12064,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Olly,I was!
12065,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Grenn,"I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn."
12066,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
12067,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
12068,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
12069,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorne,Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
12070,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Grenn and I were helping them.
12071,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorn,"Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't."
12072,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Someone has to train them.
12073,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorne,And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
12074,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorne,Get back to work. Now! I said now!
12075,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Janos Slynt,The bastardo s well-liked.You're not.
12076,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorne,You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
12077,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Janos Slynt,For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
12078,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn."
12079,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
12080,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,Name's Locke.
12081,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Jon Snow.
12082,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,You fight well.
12083,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
12084,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorne,"Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?"
12085,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,Guess I was wrong.
12086,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
12087,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
12088,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
12089,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
12090,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
12091,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
12092,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,What?
12093,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
12094,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
12095,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,She hoped or did you promise?
12096,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
12097,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
12098,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
12099,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
12100,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
12101,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
12102,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
12103,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,And?
12104,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
12105,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Cersei Lannister,"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
12106,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,Ser Pounce?
12107,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,How did you get past the Kingsguard?
12108,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,Kingsguard.
12109,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
12110,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride."
12111,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?"
12112,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,Yes. But if my mother found out...
12113,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace..."
12114,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,Yes? Tell me a secret.
12115,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
12116,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,That's Ser Pounce.
12117,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,Very handsome.
12118,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
12119,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
12120,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,No. I don't think I am.
12121,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
12122,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tommen Lannister,"We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast."
12123,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then."
12124,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Margaery Tyrell,"Remember, our little secret."
12125,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,"Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
12126,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
12127,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,Valyrian steel.
12128,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Mmm. It's yours.
12129,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,I can't accept this.
12130,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
12131,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,I hope I got your measurements right.
12132,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
12133,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
12134,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,I don't need a squire.
12135,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,Of course you do.
12136,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,He'll slow me down.
12137,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
12138,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Podrick,"I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well."
12139,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
12140,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
12141,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bronn,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
12142,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
12143,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Brienne,Oathkeeper.
12144,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jaime Lannister,"Good-bye, Brienne."
12145,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Podrick,"Come on, move."
12146,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,I should neverhave taken her away.
12147,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,She wasn't safe here.
12148,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
12149,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,Castle Black could be next.
12150,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,I should go back for Gilly.
12151,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
12152,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
12153,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
12154,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
12155,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
12156,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
12157,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
12158,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sam,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
12159,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
12160,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Alliser Thorne,"Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only."
12161,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
12162,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"Ahem, brothers."
12163,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
12164,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
12165,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Locke,"Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how."
12166,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow,"Thank you, brothers."
12167,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Woman,"No, don't. Don't, please."
12168,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Woman,Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
12169,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
12170,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?"
12171,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead."
12172,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Rast.
12173,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Go outside and feed the beast.
12174,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Rast,We should kill that thing.
12175,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me."
12176,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?"
12177,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?"
12178,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards."
12179,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Women,A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
12180,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,What the fuck is that?
12181,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sissy,Craster's last child. A boy.
12182,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
12183,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
12184,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sissy,He didn't kill them. He offered them.
12185,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,To who?
12186,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Sissy,To the gods. The white walkers.
12187,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Women,A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
12188,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Shut up!
12189,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
12190,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Rast is headed that way.
12191,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Rast,Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
12192,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Rast,Fuck!
12193,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Hodor,Hodor.
12194,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,Do you hear that?
12195,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,Is that a baby?
12196,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jojen,It's coming.
12197,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,I'm going out there.
12198,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"No, we need to stay together."
12199,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,I'm going.
12200,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Jojen,Bran. Bran.
12201,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12202,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"Bran, what happened?"
12203,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,"Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap."
12204,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,Who?
12205,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,"I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost."
12206,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
12207,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?"
12208,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go."
12209,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,No.
12210,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"Bran, we need to go now."
12211,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,I'm not leaving without Summer.
12212,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,Can you remember where the cage was?
12213,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,The east side of the keep.
12214,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet..."
12215,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Rast,"If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world."
12216,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Help him up.
12217,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
12218,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?"
12219,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
12220,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,"See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed."
12221,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Rast,What the fuck's wrong with him?
12222,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Come here.
12223,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,"No, please. Please.Please, let me help him."
12224,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,Who are you?
12225,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,Please.
12226,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Bran Stark,I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
12227,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Rast,It's Jon Snow's brother.
12228,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
12229,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Tanner,And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.
12230,2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,Meera,I'm right here.
12231,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Septon,"May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times. May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden. And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!"
12232,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,All,Long may he reign!
12233,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Septon,Special day.
12234,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Pycelle,Your Grace.
12235,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Varys,Your Grace.
12236,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,Your Grace.
12237,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,Your Grace.
12238,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,There he is.
12239,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,Long may he reign.
12240,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Long may he reign.
12241,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,He sits the throne like he was born to it.
12242,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
12243,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,"No, he wasn't."
12244,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,You still mourn for Joffrey?
12245,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,He was my husband. My king.
12246,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,He would have been your nightmare.
12247,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,"Your Grace, I feel..."
12248,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
12249,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,No.
12250,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
12251,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,"It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
12252,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
12253,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,He has you.
12254,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
12255,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,"Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it."
12256,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
12257,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
12258,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Margaery Tyrell,I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
12259,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
12260,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Barristan,"And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace."
12261,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daario,The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
12262,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,Who told you to take the Navy?
12263,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daario,No one.
12264,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,So why did you do it?
12265,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daario,I heard you liked ships.
12266,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,How many ships?
12267,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Barristan,"Ninety-three, Your Grace."
12268,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,How many men can they carry?
12269,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Barristan,"Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors."
12270,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
12271,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,The Lannisters have more.
12272,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Barristan,"They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
12273,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
12274,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Barristan,The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
12275,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
12276,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,"There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
12277,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,"Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
12278,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
12279,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
12280,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
12281,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
12282,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
12283,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
12284,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jorah Mormont,"What, then?"
12285,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Daenerys Targaryen,I will do what queens do. I will rule.
12286,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
12287,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,But how would they know?
12288,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
12289,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
12290,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
12291,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Knight,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
12292,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
12293,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Knight,Stand to.
12294,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Knight,Stand to!
12295,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Knight,"Welcome back, Lord Baelish."
12296,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Robin,Uncle Petyr!
12297,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,My lord.
12298,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,Oh. I have brought you a gift.
12299,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Lord Baelish.
12300,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,My lady.
12301,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Robin,Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
12302,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
12303,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
12304,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
12305,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,My flesh and blood.
12306,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
12307,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
12308,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Of course. I understand.
12309,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
12310,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,I would never say a thing.
12311,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
12312,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Robin,Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
12313,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"They did, and my father's."
12314,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Robin,"They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."
12315,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Make him fly?
12316,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Robin,Through the Moon Door.
12317,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
12318,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
12319,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
12320,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,No. We never...
12321,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."
12322,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
12323,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs."
12324,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,Go. We'll speak soon.
12325,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,What took you so long?
12326,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
12327,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
12328,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Let's get married tonight.
12329,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
12330,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
12331,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,I do think that we could wait until...
12332,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
12333,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,Like it was yesterday.
12334,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
12335,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
12336,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,"Tonight it is, then."
12337,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Petyr Baelish,"Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
12338,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea."
12339,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,When will the wedding take place in your mind?
12340,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
12341,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,A fortnight?
12342,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,That seems reasonable.
12343,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
12344,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,And your wedding to Loras?
12345,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Shortly after Tommen's.
12346,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,Shortly?
12347,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,A fortnight.
12348,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
12349,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,We had that in common.
12350,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
12351,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Then whom can we trust?
12352,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,Ourselves alone.
12353,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
12354,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Robert wasn't particularly rich.
12355,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
12356,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
12357,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
12358,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Haven't a clue.
12359,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,"Go on, your best guess."
12360,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"Pounds, tons, ounces?"
12361,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
12362,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,That can't be.
12363,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
12364,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Then how do we pay for anything?
12365,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
12366,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,How much?
12367,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,A tremendous amount.
12368,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
12369,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
12370,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
12371,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,"And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
12372,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
12373,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Tywin Lannister,"I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
12374,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
12375,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
12376,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
12377,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Would you shut up?
12378,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,I can't sleep until I say the names.
12379,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
12380,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,Only the ones I'm going to kill.
12381,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,"Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list."
12382,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,"If he were here right now, what would you do?"
12383,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,"I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."
12384,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,I'm almost done. Only one name left.
12385,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Go on.
12386,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,The Hound.
12387,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Thank you.
12388,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?"
12389,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Really?
12390,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
12391,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
12392,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
12393,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
12394,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
12395,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Yes. I'm very lucky.
12396,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,He feels responsible for you.
12397,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
12398,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
12399,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
12400,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Loved your mother.
12401,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,No.
12402,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,That's what you wanted to say.
12403,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
12404,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
12405,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
12406,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"No, never."
12407,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Are you pregnant?
12408,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
12409,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
12410,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
12411,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,"Your young, pretty body."
12412,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,Nothing. I'm a virgin.
12413,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Don't lie to me.
12414,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,You're hurting me.
12415,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,I'll know if you lie.
12416,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sansa Stark,"I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
12417,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Lysa,Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
12418,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
12419,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters."
12420,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,"Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
12421,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,That's a long way off.
12422,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
12423,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"Never, my lady. I'm your squire."
12424,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
12425,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"All knights have squires, my lady."
12426,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,"I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
12427,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"I swore an oath, my lady."
12428,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
12429,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,I know.
12430,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,What do you think will happen if you leave?
12431,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
12432,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,The hell you doing?
12433,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,Practicing.
12434,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,"What, ways to die?"
12435,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,No one's going to kill me.
12436,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
12437,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
12438,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
12439,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
12440,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,"Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are."
12441,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,What do you know about anything?
12442,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
12443,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,It was not.
12444,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Was? He dead?
12445,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,Yes.
12446,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,How?
12447,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,He was killed.
12448,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Who by?
12449,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
12450,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
12451,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,He was outnumbered.
12452,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
12453,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Arya Stark,Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
12454,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends."
12455,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Sandor Clegane,Your friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
12456,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,Your Grace.
12457,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
12458,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,"A poem, actually."
12459,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,May I show you the gardens?
12460,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
12461,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"No, you couldn't."
12462,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,I didn't realize you were a poet.
12463,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,Not a very good one.
12464,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,For your paramour?
12465,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,For one of my daughters.
12466,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"You have several, don't you?"
12467,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,Eight.
12468,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Eight? Eight daughters?
12469,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
12470,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Beautiful name.
12471,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,"Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry."
12472,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
12473,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,Which joke is that?
12474,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
12475,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,We can avenge them.
12476,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, we can avenge them."
12477,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
12478,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,I know he did.
12479,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
12480,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
12481,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,"The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun."
12482,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
12483,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
12484,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
12485,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,Anything at all.
12486,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
12487,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Oberyn Martell,I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
12488,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Cersei Lannister,Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
12489,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"Oh, no, no, no."
12490,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"No, no, no, no."
12491,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,Hells. Gods.
12492,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,Did you remove the skin?
12493,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"No, my lady."
12494,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
12495,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
12496,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,"No, my lady. That was the cooks."
12497,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,What are you doing?
12498,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,I'm helping you with your armor.
12499,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,"I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
12500,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
12501,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
12502,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,"Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
12503,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,I killed a man.
12504,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,Who?
12505,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
12506,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,How did you kill a Kingsguard?
12507,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Podrick,I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
12508,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Brienne,Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
12509,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Rast,"Hey. Hey, get up. Get up."
12510,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,"That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing."
12511,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,Aye. What we need is a girl there.
12512,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,I've got to have a piss.
12513,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,Now keep quiet.
12514,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Meera,You need water.
12515,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,It doesn't matter.
12516,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Meera,Of course it matters.
12517,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,You mustn't let anything stop you.
12518,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,They already have stopped me.
12519,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,No. You're not here. You're far from here.
12520,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Meera,What does that mean?
12521,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
12522,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"You've seen it, too."
12523,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,"Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it."
12524,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,We will.
12525,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
12526,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Meera,How... will we know the end?
12527,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,You'll know.
12528,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,Brothers.
12529,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Dolorous Edd,You do move quiet.
12530,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,How many?
12531,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
12532,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Grenn,Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
12533,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
12534,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Grenn,Not yet.
12535,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
12536,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,Why?
12537,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,"They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better."
12538,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Grenn,New moon tonight.
12539,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,Get some rest. We move at sundown.
12540,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
12541,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,Get her up.
12542,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Stop.
12543,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,Stop. What are you doing?
12544,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12545,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Stop. Stop!
12546,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
12547,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Stop! Please.
12548,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Hodor,Hodor.
12549,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"Please, get off her!"
12550,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"Please! Please, leave her alone!"
12551,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"Please, stop. Stop."
12552,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,What are you doing? Leave her alone!
12553,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,No!
12554,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,"Shh. Shh, shh, shh."
12555,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl,Shh.
12556,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,"You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?"
12557,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,"If you let my sister go, I can help you."
12558,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,You can help me?
12559,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,I can.
12560,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,And how you gonna do that?
12561,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,I have the sight. I can see things.
12562,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,That's very helpful.
12563,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,Things that haven't happened yet.
12564,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,What a fine thing. A fine thing.
12565,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
12566,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,No.
12567,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,Don't close your eyes.
12568,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
12569,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,To arms!
12570,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Rast,"They're here, the Night's Watch."
12571,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,"Rescue party is here, lads. Lady."
12572,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Is Jon with you?
12573,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,Aye. I'll take you to him.
12574,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,You're Brandon Stark?
12575,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,"The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy."
12576,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bronn,Jon! Jon!
12577,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Locke,Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?
12578,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Hodor,Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.
12579,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
12580,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"Hodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose."
12581,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"Hodor, get his knife. Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor."
12582,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,"Jojen and Meera, free them. Go!"
12583,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Jon.
12584,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Jon!
12585,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,"If he sees you, he won't let you go north."
12586,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,He's my brother.
12587,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,And wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black.
12588,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jojen,You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
12589,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,Hodor.
12590,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Bran Stark,We need to free Summer. And we need to go.
12591,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?
12592,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.
12593,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,You learn how to fight in a castle?
12594,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,"Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?"
12595,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,How to fight with honor?
12596,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,You know what's wrong with honor?
12597,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Karl Tanner,You.
12598,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.
12599,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,We lost four brothers?
12600,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Doloroud Edd,Five.
12601,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Grenn,What the seven hells could do that to a man?
12602,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,I count ten dead mutineers.
12603,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Grenn,Locke said there were eleven of them.
12604,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Dolrous Edd,Where's Rast?
12605,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Man,Here's another.
12606,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Grenn,Jon.
12607,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,Where in seven hells? Come here.
12608,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,"I missed you, boy."
12609,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Dolorous Edd,What should we do with this lot?
12610,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
12611,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Morag,"Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way."
12612,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Jon Snow,You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
12613,2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,Morag,Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
12614,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--"
12615,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,We've been here since midday.
12616,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--"
12617,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit."
12618,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?"
12619,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
12620,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
12621,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
12622,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"Yes, we have heard this story."
12623,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,It's not a story. It's the truth.
12624,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
12625,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,Gold you loaned him.
12626,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
12627,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,More than any man living.
12628,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
12629,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,"4,000."
12630,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
12631,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,32.
12632,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
12633,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,None.
12634,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
12635,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,My lord.
12636,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,"I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
12637,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
12638,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
12639,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,The war is over.
12640,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
12641,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,Ser Davos...
12642,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,Humor me.
12643,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,Tywin Lannister.
12644,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,How old is Tywin Lannister?
12645,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,67.
12646,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Stannis Baratheon,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
12647,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tycho,That is a problem for another time.
12648,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
12649,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,"The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, ""Bring me my red shirt."" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, ""Two pirate ships!"" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, ""Bring me my red shirt!"""
12650,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,"After the battle, the first mate asks, ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"" The captain replies, ""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."" The next morning the lookout screams, ""10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!"" The crew goes silent."
12651,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,"They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows..."
12652,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Women,Bring me my brown pants!
12653,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
12654,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
12655,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,Only half rotted.
12656,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,"Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--"
12657,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Lhara,I am Lhara.
12658,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,"She's an artist, this one, truly."
12659,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise."
12660,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,We?
12661,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,"You, me-- we."
12662,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
12663,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
12664,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
12665,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Sallador,"You're not my friend, my friend."
12666,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Davos,I'll see you at sunrise.
12667,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."
12668,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Myranda,Yes!
12669,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince. Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you."
12670,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Myranda,Yes! Yes!
12671,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing."
12672,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,First Mate,Go left.
12673,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,Theon Greyjoy.
12674,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Bolton Guard,I don't know--
12675,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.
12676,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Bolton Guard,He's not in the dungeons.
12677,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Bolton Guard,Last cage on the right.
12678,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,Thank you.
12679,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,This way!
12680,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,We're going home.
12681,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,No!
12682,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"It's all right. It's me, Yara."
12683,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
12684,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you."
12685,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!
12686,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,First Mate,They're here.
12687,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him."
12688,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,"No, you can't! You can't!"
12689,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,You're Theon Greyjoy.
12690,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,"No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!"
12691,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,This is turning into a lovely evening.
12692,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
12693,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,Aah! Theon!
12694,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
12695,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...
12696,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,how fast can you run?
12697,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,"Make for the ship, now."
12698,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ironborn,But your brother.
12699,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Yara Greyjoy,My brother is dead.
12700,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,I have a treat for you. A reward.
12701,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,Reward?
12702,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,"Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal."
12703,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--
12704,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,"Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now."
12705,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,"The britches, too, Reek. Take them off."
12706,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,"Do you love me, Reek?"
12707,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes, of course, my lord."
12708,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,"Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back."
12709,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,But how can--
12710,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
12711,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Theon Greyjoy,Pretend to be who?
12712,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Ramsay Bolton,Theon Greyjoy.
12713,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,"You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend."
12714,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Missandei,The Queen says you may approach and speak.
12715,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Missandei,He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
12716,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,I thank him for his prayers.
12717,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Missandei,"It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock."
12718,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Missandei,"He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing."
12719,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,"Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,"
12720,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
12721,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,Send the next one in.
12722,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Manservant,The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
12723,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
12724,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
12725,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,I thank you.
12726,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
12727,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,Then it is my honor to receive you.
12728,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included."
12729,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,"For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him."
12730,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly."
12731,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,Your father crucified innocent children.
12732,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?"
12733,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,"I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
12734,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
12735,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,And what traditions do you speak of?
12736,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."
12737,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials."
12738,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
12739,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world."
12740,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,"Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq."
12741,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Hizdahr,"Thank you, my queen."
12742,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,How many more?
12743,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Missandei,"There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace."
12744,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Daenerys Targaryen,212?
12745,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,"These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?"
12746,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mace,Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
12747,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mace,"Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--"
12748,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
12749,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
12750,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,A coward and a traitor.
12751,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
12752,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,Disgraceful.
12753,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
12754,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
12755,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Make it 100. What else?
12756,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
12757,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,The Targaryen girl?
12758,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
12759,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,Conquered with what?
12760,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
12761,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,"Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
12762,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,Mormont is spying on her for us.
12763,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
12764,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
12765,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
12766,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
12767,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
12768,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
12769,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
12770,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,"How, my lord? By force?"
12771,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
12772,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
12773,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
12774,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,Prince Oberyn.
12775,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Lord Varys...
12776,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
12777,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,And yet everyone does.
12778,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
12779,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Five years.
12780,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,May I ask why?
12781,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
12782,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,Most of us aren't princes.
12783,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
12784,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
12785,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
12786,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,It's a long story.
12787,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,One you don't like telling people.
12788,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,People I trust.
12789,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,"My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
12790,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,You did like boys before?
12791,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
12792,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
12793,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,What then?
12794,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,Nothing.
12795,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Everybody is interested in something.
12796,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
12797,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Such as?
12798,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
12799,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Really?
12800,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,Father's orders.
12801,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
12802,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Man,Kingslayer!
12803,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tommen Lannister,"I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused."
12804,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"
12805,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,No.
12806,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
12807,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Not that I know of.
12808,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"How would you say he died, then?"
12809,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Choked on his pigeon pie.
12810,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,So you would blame the bakers?
12811,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
12812,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,The crown may call its first witness.
12813,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Meryn Trant,"Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
12814,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
12815,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Silence.
12816,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
12817,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
12818,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,"Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--"
12819,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,"I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store."
12820,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,"Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
12821,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,By whom?
12822,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,"By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
12823,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
12824,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,Without question.
12825,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pycelle,"This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
12826,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
12827,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Pyelle,It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
12828,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
12829,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mace,Your own brother said this to you?
12830,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
12831,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,"Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
12832,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Cersei Lannister,I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
12833,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
12834,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mace,Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
12835,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
12836,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mace,And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
12837,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
12838,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"You're excused, Lord Varys."
12839,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
12840,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,One.
12841,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
12842,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Varys,"Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
12843,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,We will adjourn for now.
12844,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Toll the bells in an hour's time.
12845,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Guard,Clear the court!
12846,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,You'd condemn your own son to death?
12847,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
12848,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
12849,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,I know nothing of the sort.
12850,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,You've always hated Tyrion.
12851,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,He killed his king.
12852,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
12853,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
12854,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,Justice?
12855,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
12856,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,He'll be executed.
12857,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"No, he'll be punished accordingly."
12858,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
12859,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,I'm well aware of your oath.
12860,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
12861,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
12862,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
12863,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Done.
12864,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
12865,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,You have my word.
12866,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,And you have mine.
12867,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Not going well, is it?"
12868,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,You're going to be found guilty.
12869,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, you think so?"
12870,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
12871,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
12872,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
12873,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,How do you know?
12874,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,Do you trust me?
12875,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Jaime Lannister,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
12876,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,The crown may call its next witness.
12877,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,State your name.
12878,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,Shae.
12879,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
12880,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,I swear it.
12881,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Do you know this man?
12882,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
12883,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,How do you know him?
12884,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
12885,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
12886,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,I know that he's guilty.
12887,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,He and Sansa planned it together.
12888,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Silence! Continue.
12889,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,"She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
12890,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
12891,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
12892,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
12893,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mace,I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
12894,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,His whore.
12895,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,How did you come to be in his service?
12896,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,"He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
12897,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Silence. Silence!
12898,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,And did you?
12899,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,Did I what?
12900,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Oberyn Martell,Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
12901,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,"I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
12902,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,Shae. Please don't.
12903,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Shae,"I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
12904,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
12905,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,You wish to confess?
12906,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
12907,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
12908,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
12909,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,You admit you poisoned the king?
12910,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
12911,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
12912,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
12913,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Have you nothing to say in your defense?
12914,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
12915,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,"Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
12916,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
12917,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tywin Lannister,Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
12918,2014-05-11,Season 4,Episode 6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Tyrion Lannister,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
12919,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
12920,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
12921,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
12922,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
12923,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,You fell in love with a whore.
12924,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
12925,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
12926,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
12927,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
12928,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
12929,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
12930,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
12931,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
12932,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,It is tempting.
12933,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
12934,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,If he wins.
12935,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
12936,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jaime Lannister,No. Not Ser Meryn.
12937,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Guard,"Go on, move it."
12938,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Guard,And you. Come on.
12939,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Prisoner,"Mercy. Please. Please, mercy."
12940,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Cersei Lannister,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
12941,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Cersei Lannister,You seem to be in good form.
12942,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Mountain,Who am I fighting?
12943,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Cersei Lannister,Does it matter?
12944,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,Could be food.
12945,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,Could be soldiers.
12946,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
12947,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,"Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down."
12948,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,"Who were ""they""?"
12949,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,I stopped asking a while ago.
12950,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,That's not gonna get better.
12951,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,Doesn't seem so.
12952,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
12953,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
12954,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,So why go on?
12955,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,Habit.
12956,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,Nothing could be worse than this.
12957,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,Maybe nothing is worse than this.
12958,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
12959,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,Who are you?
12960,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
12961,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,You her father?
12962,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
12963,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,"A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work."
12964,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Dying Man,Wish it were wine.
12965,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,So do I.
12966,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
12967,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,The fuck you doing?
12968,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Rorge,There's a price on your head.
12969,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
12970,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Rorge,The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
12971,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,"And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?"
12972,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
12973,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
12974,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,He can't be. I don't know his name.
12975,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,What's your name?
12976,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Rorge,Rorge.
12977,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,Thank you.
12978,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,You're learning.
12979,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Man,Rangers returning!
12980,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Man,They return!
12981,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,Greetings.
12982,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Man,Didn't think I'd see you again.
12983,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sam,"All right, Jon?"
12984,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Man,"Welcome back, brother."
12985,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,Lord Snow.
12986,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
12987,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,"Come on, Ghost."
12988,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
12989,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Janos Slynt,"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?"
12990,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,We need to prepare.
12991,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,We've been preparing.
12992,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
12993,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,And how would we range north?
12994,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,We wouldn't.
12995,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,"Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?"
12996,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Grenn,We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.
12997,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel."
12998,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
12999,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
13000,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,They won't stop them.
13001,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow."
13002,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,The stewards.
13003,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
13004,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,No.
13005,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,Who would that be?
13006,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jon Snow,The builders.
13007,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,"Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?"
13008,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Yarwick,No.
13009,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,"Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon."
13010,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Alliser,"Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall."
13011,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Yarwick,Aye.
13012,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,My lord.
13013,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,You have new clothes.
13014,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
13015,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,I sent for you days ago.
13016,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,I've been a bit busy.
13017,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Doing what?
13018,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
13019,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
13020,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
13021,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,She's dim-witted.
13022,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
13023,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
13024,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
13025,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
13026,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,Falyse is forty and barren.
13027,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
13028,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
13029,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
13030,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
13031,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
13032,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
13033,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
13034,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
13035,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
13036,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
13037,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
13038,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
13039,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
13040,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Does he frighten you so much?
13041,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
13042,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Because you're my friend.
13043,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
13044,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
13045,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,I understand.
13046,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
13047,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
13048,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,We had some good days together.
13049,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, we did."
13050,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,What will you do?
13051,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
13052,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Bronn,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
13053,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
13054,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,But your window is not.
13055,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
13056,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't do that again.
13057,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
13058,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
13059,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,"Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you."
13060,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Tell me why you're here.
13061,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,"I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents."
13062,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
13063,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
13064,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
13065,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,"There is only one, and she does not want me."
13066,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,You swore me your sword.
13067,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,My sword is yours till the day I die.
13068,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
13069,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
13070,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Very well.
13071,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Do what you do best.
13072,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Take off your clothes.
13073,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,Oh.
13074,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,"Come in, my queen. Please."
13075,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,"I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
13076,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,You could never disturb me.
13077,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
13078,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
13079,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,"No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
13080,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,"When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
13081,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,It was. I- humor isn't my strength.
13082,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
13083,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
13084,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,Not always.
13085,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,"Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."
13086,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,Did you use it with Stannis?
13087,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
13088,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
13089,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,"No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
13090,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,I understand how you feel.
13091,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,Hmm.
13092,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,But that is impossible.
13093,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Selyse,Why?
13094,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,"You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself."
13095,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Melisandre,"However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."
13096,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daario,Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
13097,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,Khaleesi.
13098,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,You're here early.
13099,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,Later than some.
13100,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,You don't approve?
13101,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
13102,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,You neither approve nor trust.
13103,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
13104,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
13105,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,I did.
13106,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,I trust you.
13107,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
13108,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
13109,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,You have?
13110,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,I have.
13111,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
13112,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
13113,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
13114,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
13115,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
13116,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
13117,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
13118,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
13119,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
13120,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
13121,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
13122,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
13123,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
13124,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Jorah Mormont,"Yes, Khaleesi."
13125,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Daenerys Targaryen,No. Tell him you changed my mind.
13126,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
13127,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,"You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
13128,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,No fire.
13129,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
13130,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,No fire!
13131,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,"Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going."
13132,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,"I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
13133,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
13134,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,Why?
13135,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sandor Clegane,"Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
13136,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Arya Stark,Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
13137,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
13138,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"Couldn't agree more, my lady."
13139,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
13140,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"Yes, my lady."
13141,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,Don't get drunk.
13142,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"No, my lady."
13143,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,Can I get you anything else?
13144,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
13145,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,Thanks. I do my best.
13146,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,"A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
13147,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,No.
13148,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,"Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
13149,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,We're looking for someone.
13150,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-
13151,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
13152,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,"Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
13153,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,"No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here."
13154,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
13155,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
13156,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,What?
13157,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"It's nothing, my lady."
13158,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
13159,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
13160,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
13161,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
13162,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
13163,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,What about? Not kidney pie.
13164,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
13165,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
13166,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,She weren't when I last spoke to her.
13167,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,When was that?
13168,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,"Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
13169,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,So what happened to her?
13170,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,Well-
13171,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,The quick version.
13172,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
13173,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,The Hound.
13174,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Hot Pie,"That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."
13175,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,"Um, you were saying?"
13176,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
13177,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."
13178,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,Why the Eyrie?
13179,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."
13180,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,"Sansa could be there, too."
13181,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,"Aye, my lady. Could be."
13182,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Brienne,You sure about this?
13183,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Podrick,No.
13184,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
13185,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
13186,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
13187,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,Your sister.
13188,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Oh.
13189,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
13190,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
13191,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
13192,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
13193,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
13194,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,I think I would have remembered that.
13195,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
13196,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
13197,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
13198,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,That would have made things so much easier.
13199,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
13200,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
13201,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
13202,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Tyrion Lannister,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
13203,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,I disagree.
13204,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Oberyn Martell,"I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."
13205,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"Hello, Robin."
13206,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,What are you doing?
13207,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
13208,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,Why did you leave?
13209,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,It's a long story.
13210,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
13211,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"Yes, you certainly are."
13212,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,When will you go back?
13213,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
13214,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
13215,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
13216,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
13217,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,We don't.
13218,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
13219,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
13220,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,"Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."
13221,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,I like the sound of that.
13222,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
13223,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,All right.
13224,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,It can go in here in this big tower.
13225,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
13226,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,I didn't ruin it.
13227,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,You did.
13228,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
13229,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
13230,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Robin,I didn't ruin it!
13231,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,You're being stupid.
13232,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
13233,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,Children.
13234,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,I hit him.
13235,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"Yes, I saw."
13236,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,I shouldn't have done that.
13237,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
13238,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
13239,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
13240,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
13241,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
13242,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
13243,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
13244,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
13245,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,Lord Baelish...
13246,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,Call me Petyr.
13247,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
13248,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,"Come here, Sansa."
13249,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,Do you know how far the fall is?
13250,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,No.
13251,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,"Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."
13252,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
13253,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,"Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr."
13254,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,I didn't. You don't understand.
13255,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
13256,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,He kissed me. I pulled away.
13257,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,Liar! Whore! He is mine!
13258,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Sansa Stark,Please!
13259,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,"My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!"
13260,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,Lysa! Let her go.
13261,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,You want her? This empty-headed child?
13262,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,Let her go.
13263,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Lysa,She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
13264,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
13265,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
13266,2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,Petyr Baelish,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
13267,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Man,Here we are.
13268,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Man,The Rains of Castamere!
13269,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Moles Town Whore,"You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
13270,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Man,"Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!"
13271,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Moles Town Whore,"There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
13272,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Gilly,Yes.
13273,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Moles Town Whore,"Well, what are you going to say?"
13274,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Gilly,I'm sorry it woke you up.
13275,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Moles Town Whore,"I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
13276,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Gilly,Don't you ever touch him.
13277,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Moles Town Whore,"Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You shouldo ve stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
13278,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Gilly,Shut your mouth.
13279,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Moles Town Whore,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
13280,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Gilly,No it's not.
13281,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sam,I should never have left her there.
13282,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jon Snow,You couldn't have known.
13283,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sam,Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
13284,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grenn,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
13285,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ed,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
13286,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grenn,"Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
13287,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ed,I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
13288,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grenn,We pledged to guard the realms of men.
13289,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sam,She's dead because of me.
13290,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grenn,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
13291,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jon Snow,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
13292,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sam,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
13293,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Pyp,"Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
13294,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ed,She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
13295,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sam,She might have.
13296,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jon Snow,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
13297,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ed,A hundred thousand.
13298,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grenn,"And there's what, 5 of us left."
13299,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ed,"If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
13300,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Pyp,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
13301,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ed,"Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."
13302,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,You think he was spying on you?
13303,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,"No, not spying."
13304,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
13305,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,Yes your grace.
13306,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,But you are not Dothraki.
13307,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,No.
13308,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
13309,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,He was interested.
13310,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,What?
13311,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,I believe he was interested.
13312,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
13313,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,All of it?
13314,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,The...the pillar an the stones.
13315,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,"I don't know, your grace."
13316,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,Haven't you ever wondered?
13317,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,"Yes, your grace."
13318,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
13319,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
13320,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
13321,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,in Valyrian* No.
13322,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,"The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
13323,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,To me.
13324,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,To me.
13325,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
13326,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
13327,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
13328,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
13329,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,"When they cut you, do you remember that?"
13330,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
13331,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,Why? Why sorry?
13332,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
13333,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,"approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
13334,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
13335,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missandei,in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
13336,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Grey Worm,in Valyrian* So am I.
13337,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
13338,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
13339,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,And what are you really?
13340,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,I'm Reek.
13341,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
13342,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,Until when?
13343,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,Always. Forever.
13344,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
13345,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Guard,to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
13346,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
13347,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,Yes.
13348,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,And why should I believe that?
13349,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
13350,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Everyone,What is dead may never die.
13351,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
13352,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
13353,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,And what does Lord Bolton want?
13354,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
13355,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,He wants us to surrender?
13356,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
13357,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,shame fought with honor.
13358,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
13359,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
13360,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,scared* You don't know.
13361,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,The Ironborn will not surrender.
13362,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,whispering* Reek. Reek.
13363,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ralf,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
13364,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,Reek.
13365,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Man,"If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
13366,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
13367,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
13368,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Theon Greyjoy,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
13369,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,I believe we will. To our new home.
13370,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
13371,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
13372,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
13373,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
13374,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,My lord...
13375,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
13376,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
13377,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
13378,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
13379,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
13380,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
13381,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
13382,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
13383,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"A niece of yours, I believe."
13384,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
13385,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,We'd like to speak with her.
13386,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,Let me fetch her.
13387,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
13388,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
13389,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,My lady...
13390,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,I wasn't asking you.
13391,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,He can stay.
13392,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
13393,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
13394,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
13395,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
13396,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
13397,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
13398,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Vance,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
13399,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
13400,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
13401,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
13402,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,Lady Sansa.
13403,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
13404,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
13405,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
13406,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
13407,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
13408,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
13409,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
13410,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
13411,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,Are you questioning our courage?
13412,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
13413,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
13414,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
13415,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
13416,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
13417,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
13418,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
13419,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lady Anya,More often they die young.
13420,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
13421,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Royce,"Aye, it's time."
13422,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
13423,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Boy,Ser Barristan.
13424,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,Yes? Who sent you?
13425,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Ser Barristan.
13426,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,Ser Jorah.
13427,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
13428,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,No.
13429,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,What's this?
13430,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
13431,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Who gave you this?
13432,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,Does it matter?
13433,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Have you told her?
13434,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
13435,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Let me speak with her in private.
13436,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Barristan,You'll never be alone with her again.
13437,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,Why did the usurper pardon you?
13438,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,If we could speak alone.
13439,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
13440,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
13441,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
13442,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,It is not forged.
13443,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,"Why, then?"
13444,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,"I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
13445,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,What was the content of these letters?
13446,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Information.
13447,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,What information?
13448,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
13449,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13450,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,I...
13451,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,Yes or no?
13452,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Khaleesi.
13453,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
13454,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,Yes.
13455,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
13456,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
13457,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,Because you knew it was poisoned.
13458,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,I suspected.
13459,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,You betrayed me from the first.
13460,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,"Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
13461,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
13462,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
13463,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,and you want me to forgive you?
13464,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,I have loved you.
13465,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
13466,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ser Jorah,"Daenerys, please."
13467,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Daenerys Targaryen,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
13468,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
13469,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Lord Bolton,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
13470,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,No.
13471,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
13472,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"Moors, fields, hills."
13473,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,Tell me what you see.
13474,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,Nothing.
13475,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Roose,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
13476,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,Ramsay Snow.
13477,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Roose,"No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
13478,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
13479,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ramsay Bolton,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
13480,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,Yes?
13481,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
13482,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
13483,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,That's not an answer.
13484,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
13485,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,I don't know.
13486,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,Neither do I.
13487,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
13488,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,I know what you want.
13489,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,Do you?
13490,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
13491,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,Lots of things make me happy.
13492,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,Like what?
13493,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
13494,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
13495,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
13496,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
13497,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
13498,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
13499,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
13500,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
13501,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,You should have let me burn it.
13502,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,It's a fleabite.
13503,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
13504,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
13505,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
13506,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"Aye, she'll pay."
13507,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,I've never even met her.
13508,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
13509,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya Stark,I'm not a lady.
13510,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Guard,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
13511,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sandor Clegane,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
13512,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Guard,Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
13513,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Robin,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
13514,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,You shouldn't be.
13515,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Robin,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
13516,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Petyr,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
13517,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa Stark,Shall we go?
13518,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
13519,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Soon.
13520,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
13521,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,I've never seen him fight.
13522,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
13523,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Oberyn believes in himself.
13524,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
13525,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Beheading.
13526,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
13527,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Cousins.
13528,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
13529,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
13530,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
13531,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Together,Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
13532,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,Nothing made him happier.
13533,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
13534,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
13535,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,"The joke wore thin, though."
13536,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,For you. You drifted away.
13537,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,I had other interests.
13538,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
13539,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Why?
13540,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
13541,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
13542,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
13543,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
13544,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
13545,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,He was twice your size.
13546,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
13547,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,I don't know.
13548,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Jaime Lannister,Good luck today.
13549,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,Looks like very light armor.
13550,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,I like to move around.
13551,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
13552,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
13553,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
13554,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,Today is not the day I die.
13555,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ellaria,You're going to fight that?
13556,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,I'm going to kill that.
13557,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ellaria,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
13558,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
13559,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion Lannister,Thank the gods.
13560,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Pycell,"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
13561,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Ellaria,Don't leave me alone in this world.
13562,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,Never.
13563,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,Have they told you who I am?
13564,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Mountain,Some dead man.
13565,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
13566,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
13567,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
13568,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
13569,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,You raped her! You murdered her!
13570,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,You killed her children!
13571,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Oberyn Martell,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
13572,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Mountain,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
13573,2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tywin Lannister,"standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
13574,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,What was she like?
13575,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,She...she had red hair.
13576,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Oh? How big were her feet?
13577,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Well what do you want me to say?
13578,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
13579,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,So you and Gilly never-
13580,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
13581,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
13582,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
13583,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,What?
13584,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
13585,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
13586,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
13587,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
13588,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"No, you're really not."
13589,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
13590,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
13591,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,There will.
13592,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
13593,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
13594,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
13595,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,Yes.
13596,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,"Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
13597,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
13598,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,We could be waiting here a while.
13599,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
13600,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Styr,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
13601,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
13602,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Styr,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
13603,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,I probably killed him already.
13604,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Styr,So you've said.
13605,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
13606,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Styr,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
13607,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
13608,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Styr,Maybe I have.
13609,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
13610,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
13611,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
13612,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
13613,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Let me help you.
13614,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
13615,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Maester Faull
13616,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
13617,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
13618,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
13619,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I don't love her.
13620,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,Yes you do.
13621,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,No.
13622,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
13623,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,You were?
13624,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
13625,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
13626,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
13627,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Who was she?
13628,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Aemon,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
13629,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
13630,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
13631,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,"I'm sorry, I can't."
13632,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
13633,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Pyp! Open the gate.
13634,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,I can't.
13635,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,"Sam, is that you?!"
13636,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Yes!
13637,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
13638,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
13639,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,I've never heard you curse before.
13640,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
13641,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
13642,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,It was horrible.
13643,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
13644,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
13645,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Never.
13646,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,I know there's no women allowed.
13647,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
13648,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,Get ready!
13649,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Thenn Warg,It's time.
13650,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,Pick up the pace!
13651,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
13652,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,A hundred thousand you say?
13653,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Yes sir.
13654,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,You can say it if you like. We shouldo ve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
13655,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
13656,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
13657,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
13658,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,You're leaving me again?
13659,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I'm not leaving you!
13660,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
13661,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
13662,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,What are you going to do out there?
13663,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Help my brothers.
13664,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
13665,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
13666,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
13667,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
13668,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Gilly,Promise me you won't die.
13669,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,I promise you I won't die.
13670,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
13671,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
13672,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
13673,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
13674,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
13675,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,But you're afraid now?
13676,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
13677,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
13678,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Styr,How high are the walls?
13679,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
13680,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,Let's kill some Crows!
13681,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
13682,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,"Archers knock, everyone else hold."
13683,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
13684,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Nights Watch,No Ser!
13685,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
13686,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,You all plan to die here tonight?
13687,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,That's very good to hear. Draw!
13688,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Member,"Help, down below."
13689,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,They're attacking the southern gates!
13690,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,Now?
13691,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,Now!
13692,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,"I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
13693,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,What?!
13694,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,"What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
13695,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,You heard the man. Loose!
13696,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,"You, over there."
13697,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Did you get one?
13698,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,"No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
13699,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Yeah?
13700,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,I think we're gonna die.
13701,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,If you keep missing we will.
13702,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
13703,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Nights Watch,No!
13704,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,"Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
13705,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,The Night's Watch will stand.
13706,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,"With me now! Now, with me!"
13707,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
13708,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,We can't just let them attack the gate!
13709,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
13710,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
13711,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
13712,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,"Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."
13713,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Janos,Needed below? Yes. Yes.
13714,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
13715,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,They won't summit before dawn.
13716,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,How do you know that?
13717,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Because I've made that claim.
13718,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
13719,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Knock! Draw! Loose!
13720,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,"I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead."
13721,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Oh, is it over?"
13722,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp,Huh?
13723,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
13724,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
13725,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Now!
13726,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,Now!
13727,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
13728,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,Alright.
13729,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
13730,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,"They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!"
13731,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Oil!
13732,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,Oil on the ramp!
13733,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,Protect the gate!
13734,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Alliser,Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
13735,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,to Grenn* We need more men down here.
13736,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,We have to hold the gate.
13737,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,But we need men here.
13738,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
13739,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
13740,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
13741,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
13742,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,What are you doing up here?
13743,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
13744,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
13745,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Two brothers now fight with me.
13746,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!"
13747,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Donnel,How are we gonna stop that?
13748,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Cooper,We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
13749,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,"You heard Jon, we hold the gate."
13750,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Donnel,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
13751,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,We hold the gate!
13752,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Donnel,Mother save me. Father save me.
13753,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,"The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?"
13754,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Donnel,"No, please."
13755,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"
13756,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,All Together,"And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!"
13757,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,to Sam* I don't want you out there.
13758,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
13759,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,I need him more than I need you.
13760,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,We need you boy.
13761,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,Jon Snow.
13762,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"No, shh, don't talk."
13763,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,Do you remember that cave?
13764,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,We shouldo ve stayed in that cave.
13765,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,We'll go back there.
13766,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
13767,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,"Drop the scythe, boys!"
13768,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,Hoister up!
13769,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,They've had enough for one night.
13770,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Ed,Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
13771,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
13772,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,This is how a man ends.
13773,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
13774,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Tormund,I shouldo ve thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
13775,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Aye, you shouldo ve."
13776,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
13777,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,We held them off.
13778,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,For one night.
13779,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,This is a great victory.
13780,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
13781,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Where are you going?
13782,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,I'm going to find Mance.
13783,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
13784,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
13785,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
13786,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,I'm going to try.
13787,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
13788,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
13789,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
13790,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
13791,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
13792,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,What are you doing?
13793,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Jon Snow,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
13794,2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,Sam,Jon. Come back.
13795,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,You're wearing a black cloak again.
13796,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
13797,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
13798,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
13799,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
13800,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
13801,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
13802,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Yes.
13803,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,And?
13804,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,She's dead.
13805,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Your doing?
13806,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,No.
13807,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,We'll drink to her.
13808,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
13809,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Ygritte.
13810,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Ygritte.
13811,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,That's not wine.
13812,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
13813,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
13814,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
13815,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Grenn came from a farm.
13816,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Mag and Grenn.
13817,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Grenn and Mag.
13818,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
13819,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Turn your army around and go home.
13820,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
13821,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
13822,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
13823,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
13824,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,You attacking us?
13825,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
13826,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Hold! To me. To me.
13827,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
13828,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,You're the king beyond the wall?
13829,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,You know who I am?
13830,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,Never had the pleasure.
13831,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Davos,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
13832,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
13833,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
13834,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,We do not kneel.
13835,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
13836,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Mance,"All the same, we do not kneel."
13837,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,Take these men away.
13838,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Davos,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
13839,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
13840,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Davos,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
13841,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
13842,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,Your father was an honorable man.
13843,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"He was, your grace."
13844,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,What do you think he'd have done with him?
13845,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
13846,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Stannis Baratheon,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
13847,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
13848,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
13849,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Bloody Martells.
13850,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
13851,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,"It is, yes, manticore."
13852,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,"I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
13853,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,Yes there is.
13854,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,May I ask what you think you're doing?
13855,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,Saving him.
13856,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,"Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
13857,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
13858,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,"That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
13859,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
13860,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Pycelle,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
13861,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Not anymore.
13862,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,You can save him?
13863,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
13864,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
13865,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,"Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
13866,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Will it weaken him?
13867,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Qyburn,Oh no.
13868,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Very well then.
13869,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
13870,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I'm opening it again.
13871,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
13872,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I will not.
13873,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
13874,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
13875,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
13876,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
13877,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
13878,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
13879,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,No.
13880,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
13881,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,And how will you do that?
13882,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I'll tell everyone the truth.
13883,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,And what truth would that be?
13884,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
13885,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,Known what?
13886,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
13887,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"No, no, no, no, no."
13888,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Your legacy is a lie.
13889,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,I don't believe you.
13890,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Yes you do.
13891,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Jaime.
13892,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
13893,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
13894,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Tyrion is your family.
13895,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,He's not.
13896,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,You don't get to choose.
13897,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
13898,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
13899,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
13900,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
13901,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I choose you.
13902,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Those are words.
13903,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
13904,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Told him what?
13905,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I told him about us.
13906,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,You told him?
13907,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
13908,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,You think he'll just accept that?
13909,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,Go and ask him.
13910,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,What did you say?
13911,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
13912,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Someone will walk in.
13913,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Cersei Lannister,I don't care.
13914,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Missandei,"in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons."
13915,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
13916,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,You speak it very well.
13917,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
13918,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
13919,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
13920,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
13921,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
13922,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
13923,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
13924,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,What is it that you want from me?
13925,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
13926,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
13927,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
13928,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
13929,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Fennesz,"Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
13930,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Barristan,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
13931,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Daenerys Targaryen,Approach my friend.

13948,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
13949,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tormund,You want me alive so you can torture me?
13950,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,No one's going to torture you.
13951,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tormund,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
13952,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
13953,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tormund,Who decides?
13954,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,I suppose Stannis does.

13959,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tormund,Words? What kind of words?
13960,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
13961,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tormund,Do what?
13962,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jon Snow,Say farewell.

13966,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tormund,No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?

13981,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Girl,They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.
13982,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Bran Stark,Who are you?

13987,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Old Man,"He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway."
13988,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Meera,How do you know?
13989,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Old Man,"I've been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you've come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late."
13990,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Bran Stark,I didn't want anyone to die for me.
13991,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Old Man,He died so that you could find what you have lost.
13992,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Bran Stark,You're going to help me walk again?

13995,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,I hobbled them last night.
13996,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,What sort of hobble?
13997,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,"A figure-eight, like you taught me."
13998,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
13999,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,"Thieves, maybe?"
14000,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,It's at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You're carrying the saddle bags.
14001,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,"People coming. You can shit later, there's people coming!"
14002,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Morning!

14004,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
14005,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,About ten more miles.
14006,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
14007,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Are you a knight?
14008,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,No.
14009,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,But you know how to use that sword.
14010,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I do.
14011,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Does it have a name?
14012,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Oathkeeper.”
14013,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Mine's “Needle.”
14014,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Good name.
14015,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Who taught you how to fight?
14016,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,My father.
14017,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
14018,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,"Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right.”"
14019,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,"Seven blessings. I'm Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne."
14020,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,You want something?
14021,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,That's Sandor Clegane- the Hound.
14022,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,You're Arya Stark.
14023,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,I asked if you wanted something.
14024,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
14025,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,My mother's dead.
14026,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I know. I wish I couldo ve been there to protect her.
14027,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,You're not a northerner.
14028,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,"I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
14029,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Why didn't you?
14030,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.
14031,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,You're paid by the Lannisters. You're here for the bounty on me.
14032,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I'm not paid by the Lannisters.
14033,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,"No? Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that's not Lannister gold."
14034,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
14035,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,The Bloody Gate's ten miles.
14036,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
14037,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,I don't care what you swore!
14038,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Arya!
14039,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,You heard the girl! She's not coming with you.
14040,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,She is.
14041,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,You're not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I've always wanted some Valyrian steel.
14042,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Come with me Arya. I'll take you to safety.
14043,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,"Safety?! Where the fuck's that? Her aunt in the Eyrie's dead. Her mother's dead, her father's dead, her brother's dead. Winterfell's a pile of rubble. There's no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her."
14044,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,And that's what you're doing? Watching over her?
14045,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,"Aye, that's what I'm doing."
14046,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,I have no wish to kill you Ser.
14047,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,I'm not a knight.
14048,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
14049,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,She was just here...
14050,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Why weren't you watching her?
14051,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
14052,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Brienne,Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
14053,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Podrick,"Ah, I think that way."
14054,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,You're still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
14055,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,I don't need saving.
14056,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,"No, not you. You're a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle."
14057,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,You're gonna die?
14058,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,"Unless there's a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done. I'd skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She'll help you. Going out alone, you won't last a day out there."
14059,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,I'll last longer than you.
14060,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,"You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I'm ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher's boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don't kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I shouldo ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I shouldo ve fucked her bloody. At least I'd have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it."
14061,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Sandor Clegane,Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
14062,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, get on with it you son of a whore."
14063,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Is that any way to speak about our mother?
14064,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,What're you doing?
14065,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,What do you think I'm doing? The galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
14066,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,Who's helping you?
14067,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Varys.
14068,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,Varys?
14069,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,You have more friends than you thought.
14070,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,"There's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
14071,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,"I suppose this is goodbye, then."
14072,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,"Farewell, little brother."
14073,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,"Jaime, thank you. For my life."
14074,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Jaime Lannister,Quickly now.
14075,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Woman,Tywin… my lion...
14076,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
14077,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
14078,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,"All my life, you've wanted me dead."
14079,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I'd never let Illyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son."
14080,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,I loved her.
14081,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,Who?
14082,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,Shae.
14083,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow."
14084,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,I murdered her. With my own hands.
14085,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,It doesn't matter.
14086,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,It doesn't matter?
14087,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,She was a whore!
14088,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,Say that word again.
14089,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Enough of this nonsense…
14090,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
14091,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
14092,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,I can't go back there. She's in there.
14093,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
14094,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tywin Lannister,You shot me. You're no son of mine.
14095,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Tyrion Lannister,I am your son. I have always been your son.
14096,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Varys,"What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I've brought you this far."
14097,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,I want to see the captain.
14098,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,You're seeing him.
14099,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,"I want to go north, to the wall."
14100,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,No you don't.
14101,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,I can pay.
14102,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.
14103,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,"I wouldn't need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…"
14104,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,"I'm not going north, child, we're going home."
14105,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Where's home?
14106,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,The Free City of Braavos.
14107,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,"Wait, I have something else."
14108,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,More silver won't make a difference.
14109,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,"It's not silver, it's iron."
14110,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Arya Stark,Valar morghulis.
14111,2014-06-15,Season 4,Episode 10,The Children,Captain,"How did you… valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin."
14112,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,We shouldn't be out here alone.
14113,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Why not?
14114,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,If your father hears…
14115,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,He'll never know we've been gone.
14116,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,But if he finds out…
14117,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,You don't need to be afraid of my father.
14118,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,Are you sure?
14119,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Yes.
14120,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,We shouldn't go in.
14121,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Of course we should.
14122,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,Get out. Get out!
14123,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,Let's go…
14124,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,No.
14125,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,Listen to your friend.
14126,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
14127,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,You don't know what I am.
14128,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
14129,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
14130,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
14131,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,Your blood. Give me a taste.
14132,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,Three questions you get. You won't like the answers.
14133,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
14134,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.
14135,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,But I will be queen?
14136,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,"Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
14137,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Will the king and I have children?
14138,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
14139,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,That doesn't make sense.
14140,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Maggy,Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.
14141,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melara,"Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
14142,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Priest,"Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
14143,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
14144,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Priest,"But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here…"
14145,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Priest,From all seven kingdoms…
14146,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,They will wait.
14147,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,"He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
14148,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jaime Lannister,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
14149,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,They?
14150,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jaime Lannister,All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
14151,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
14152,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jaime Lannister,This is exactly what they want.
14153,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
14154,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
14155,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,Apologies.
14156,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
14157,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
14158,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
14159,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
14160,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Pentos?
14161,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
14162,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Much better.
14163,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,My lord?
14164,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
14165,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
14166,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,In a box. Why stop now?
14167,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
14168,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,The future is shit. Just like the past.
14169,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Prostitute,You want the same? Same as always?
14170,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,White Rat,You… you don't have to.
14171,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Prostitute,Habit.
14172,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Sons of the Harpy?
14173,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Barristan,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
14174,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,They've never killed before.
14175,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Barristan,"It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
14176,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
14177,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mossador,"They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
14178,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
14179,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Grey Worm,"White Rat, your grace."
14180,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
14181,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Barristan,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
14182,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mossador,Make them very angry.
14183,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
14184,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Missandei,Torgo Nudho.
14185,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Grey Worm,Missandei hin Naath.
14186,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Missandei,I wanted to speak with you.
14187,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Grey Worm,Why do you come?
14188,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Missandei,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
14189,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Grey Worm,I do not know. I must go.
14190,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Get your shield up.
14191,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Olly,It's too heavy.
14192,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
14193,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
14194,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Gilly,"Shouldn't you be training, too?"
14195,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sam,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
14196,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Alliser,These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.
14197,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Alliser,Not soldiers.
14198,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Gilly,That one hates me.
14199,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sam,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
14200,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sam,All the wildlings.
14201,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Gilly,Don't let them send us away.
14202,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sam,"It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
14203,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Gilly,Sam! Don't let them send us away.
14204,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sam,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
14205,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Gilly,"You can't leave, they'll execute you."
14206,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
14207,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,The king wants a word.
14208,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"You're not cold, my lady?"
14209,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,"Never. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow."
14210,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,Feel.
14211,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,Are you a virgin?
14212,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,No.
14213,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,Good.
14214,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.
14215,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
14216,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Roose Bolton.
14217,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?
14218,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
14219,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Davos,I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
14220,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,They're good men.
14221,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Davos,Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
14222,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,It's where she belonged.
14223,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Davos,Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
14224,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
14225,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
14226,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
14227,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
14228,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
14229,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,"If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
14230,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Davos,It's a fair offer. More than fair.
14231,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
14232,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,I don't think that's likely.
14233,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,"You admire him, don't you?"
14234,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,I respect him.
14235,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
14236,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Your grace…
14237,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,or he burns.
14238,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,How much time do I have?
14239,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
14240,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Master Of Arms,"Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet!"
14241,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Yohn Royce,My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
14242,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
14243,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Royce,Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
14244,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Squire,My lord.
14245,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Master Of Arms,"Sword up, my lord!"
14246,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
14247,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Royce,He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.
14248,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,He has other gifts.
14249,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Royce,Does he?
14250,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
14251,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sansa Stark,"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
14252,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Royce,"I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
14253,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
14254,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Royce,"He'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
14255,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Podrick,"Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
14256,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Brienne,Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
14257,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Podrick,But I'm you're squire.
14258,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Brienne,Do you even know what a squire is?
14259,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Podrick,An attendant to a knight?
14260,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Brienne,I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
14261,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Podrick,"Well, where would I go?"
14262,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Brienne,"I don't care, I'm not your mother."
14263,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Podrick,You swore to find the Stark girls.
14264,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Brienne,I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
14265,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Podrick,Sansa still might.
14266,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Brienne,Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
14267,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sansa Stark,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
14268,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,I did.
14269,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sansa Stark,But we're heading west.
14270,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,We are.
14271,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sansa Stark,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
14272,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
14273,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sansa Stark,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
14274,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
14275,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Sansa Stark,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
14276,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Petyr Baelish,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
14277,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such…"
14278,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
14279,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Thank you so much for your kind words.
14280,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Grand Maester Pyrcelle,"Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
14281,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel Lannister,Your grace.
14282,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
14283,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel,My deepest sympathies.
14284,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Kevan Lannister,I apologize for my son's appearance.
14285,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,"Uncle, it's quite alright."
14286,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Kevan,"They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
14287,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
14288,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Kevan,Of course.
14289,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
14290,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel,It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.
14291,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,What can I do for you?
14292,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel,You can forgive me.
14293,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
14294,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel,I led you into the darkness.
14295,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
14296,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel,"I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
14297,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,I don't know what you're talking about.
14298,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Lancel,"I'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul."
14299,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Cersei Lannister,The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
14300,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Olyvar,It looks like Dorne.
14301,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,No it doesn't.
14302,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Olyvar,It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
14303,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,Sandstone.
14304,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Olyvar,"Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
14305,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,Fine.
14306,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,It's Dorne.
14307,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Olyvar,We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
14308,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,"Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
14309,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,We're late for dinner as it is.
14310,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,You're very respectful.
14311,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,I'm very hungry.
14312,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,What's your name?
14313,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Olyvar,"Olyvar, my lady."
14314,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,"I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
14315,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
14316,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
14317,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,In any event… you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.
14318,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
14319,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,Lucky you.
14320,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,Unlucky you.
14321,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
14322,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,"If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
14323,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,Perhaps.
14324,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Loras,Perhaps?
14325,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Margaery Tyrell,Perhaps?
14326,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
14327,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"Imp, half-man."
14328,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
14329,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Not for a coward.
14330,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
14331,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,You never told me why you set me free.
14332,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,Your brother asked me to.
14333,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,You could have said no.
14334,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
14335,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
14336,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
14337,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
14338,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
14339,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
14340,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
14341,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,I'm not well-suited for work.
14342,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
14343,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
14344,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,I never said you were perfect.
14345,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,What is it you want exactly?
14346,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
14347,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
14348,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
14349,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
14350,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
14351,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Good luck finding him.
14352,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Varys,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
14353,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion Lannister,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
14354,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario Naharis,When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.
14355,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr Zo Loraq,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
14356,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Good.
14357,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,They did ask for some concessions.
14358,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Concessions?
14359,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
14360,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
14361,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,"Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
14362,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,"I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
14363,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
14364,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
14365,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,"In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men."
14366,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
14367,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,No fighting pits.
14368,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
14369,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
14370,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Hizdahr,If you--
14371,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,How many times must I say no before you understand?
14372,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
14373,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,You should reopen the fighting pits.
14374,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,What?
14375,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
14376,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Why?
14377,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,"I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
14378,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
14379,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,"I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
14380,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,"You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now."
14381,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
14382,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.
14383,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
14384,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daario,A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
14385,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Viserion? Rhaegal?
14386,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Daenerys Targaryen,Easy. Easy. Easy.
14387,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,So here we are.
14388,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Here we are.
14389,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
14390,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
14391,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,"No, but it will be."
14392,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,You know what Stannis wants?
14393,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much
14394,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Shouldn't a king be bold?
14395,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him."
14396,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
14397,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
14398,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
14399,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.
14400,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,Then bend the knee and save your people.
14401,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.
14402,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
14403,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
14404,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,They'll burn you alive.
14405,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,"Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe."
14406,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
14407,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,"You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining."
14408,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow,I think you're making a terrible mistake.
14409,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
14410,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,"Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
14411,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Stannis Baratheon,Kneel and live.
14412,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Mance,This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
14413,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,"Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
14414,2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,Melisandre,"Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."
14415,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Braavosi Man,"In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies."
14416,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,He's just a statue.
14417,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.
14418,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,I'm not afraid.
14419,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,The House of Black and White
14420,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,"Here, I leave you."
14421,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Thank you for bringing me.
14422,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.
14423,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Valar dohaeris.
14424,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Hello. Valar Morghulis.
14425,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
14426,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Old Man,No one here by that name.
14427,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
14428,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Old Man,You have everywhere else to go.
14429,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,But wait!
14430,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,"Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
14431,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,"The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
14432,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,Must be good food if it's crowded.
14433,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Waitress,Ale? Ale?
14434,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
14435,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,You are becoming an observant young lady.
14436,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
14437,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
14438,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,So it was good news.?
14439,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
14440,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
14441,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Waitress,Ale?
14442,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,I'll have some.
14443,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,My lady!
14444,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,What is it?
14445,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,Sansa Stark. Don't look!
14446,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,You sure?
14447,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
14448,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Littlefinger?
14449,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,A bunch of knights with him.
14450,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
14451,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
14452,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Ready the horses.
14453,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,We only have one horse.
14454,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Find more.
14455,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,Do you like the taste?
14456,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
14457,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,It gives some men courage.
14458,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,Does it give you courage?
14459,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Guard,That's far enough.
14460,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
14461,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
14462,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
14463,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
14464,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,I was.
14465,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
14466,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,It was after Renly's murder.
14467,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
14468,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,I tried to save him.
14469,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,But you were accused.
14470,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,By men who didn't see what happened.
14471,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,Then what did happen?
14472,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
14473,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
14474,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
14475,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
14476,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
14477,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,No.
14478,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
14479,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
14480,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
14481,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sansa Stark,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
14482,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Petyr Baelish,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
14483,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Knight,He asked you to stay.
14484,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Guard,After her!
14485,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Podrick!
14486,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"Stop, stop, stop! That's a good boy."
14487,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Knight,I guess that means you're unarmed.
14488,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,"Down, Podrick, down!"
14489,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Podrick?
14490,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"Yes, my lady?"
14491,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,You can stand now.
14492,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"Yes, my lady. Sansa Stark?"
14493,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
14494,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow."
14495,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.
14496,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,If they don't want your protection--
14497,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?
14498,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Podrick,"No, my lady."
14499,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brienne,Get your horse.
14500,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,A summons from the queen.
14501,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,There are only two like it in the world
14502,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,It's a threat.
14503,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat."""
14504,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,No note.
14505,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
14506,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,Softer.
14507,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,What?
14508,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,Not so loud.
14509,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!"
14510,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,The world can't know knows she's our daughter.
14511,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.
14512,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,"If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets."
14513,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
14514,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,I'll make things better.
14515,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,You never made anything better.
14516,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.
14517,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.
14518,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,I'm not going to ask him anything.
14519,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"You go there with an army, it's an act of war."
14520,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?
14521,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
14522,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
14523,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
14524,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,I never said I was going alone.
14525,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys Stokeworth,"No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
14526,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,Don't they?
14527,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Don't who?
14528,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
14529,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
14530,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
14531,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,You won't.
14532,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Pardon?
14533,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,"We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
14534,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Oh.
14535,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,"She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
14536,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
14537,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,She is.
14538,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
14539,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Lollys,Who's that?
14540,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Jaime fucking Lannister.
14541,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Ser Jaime.
14542,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
14543,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,I was very sorry to hear about your father.
14544,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,Thank you.
14545,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,"This is my betrothed, Lollys."
14546,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,A pleasure.
14547,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,"Run along, love."
14548,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
14549,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Just get on with it.
14550,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,On with what?
14551,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
14552,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,It's very good for you.
14553,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
14554,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,Mmm.
14555,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
14556,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,I would have advised against that.
14557,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,How is this good for me?
14558,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
14559,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Bronn,Return from where?
14560,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaime Lannister,As far south as south goes.
14561,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Trystane,My future queen.
14562,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Areo,The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
14563,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,"Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--"
14564,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,Captain. Let her pass.
14565,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,"Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
14566,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,"Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
14567,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,Your brother--
14568,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
14569,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,What will you do about his death.
14570,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
14571,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,You would have me go to war?
14572,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,You would have me go to war?
14573,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,The whole country would have you go to war.
14574,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
14575,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
14576,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,"Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
14577,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Doran,I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
14578,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Ellaria,And how long will that be?
14579,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
14580,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,"Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
14581,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,"My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
14582,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Grey Worm,No one here. We go.
14583,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,In a hurry? You're afraid?
14584,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Grey Worm,Unsullied fear nothing.
14585,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,"Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
14586,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,Fear is useful that way.
14587,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,"Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
14588,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,It would send a message.
14589,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
14590,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,Why?
14591,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
14592,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
14593,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,How do you know that?
14594,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,Because I questioned him.
14595,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Hizdahr,"And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
14596,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,He is born free.
14597,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Hizdahr,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
14598,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
14599,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
14600,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Hizdahr,And how do you know this?
14601,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,Everyone knows this.
14602,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Hizdahr,"I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
14603,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
14604,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,"I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial"
14605,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,Thank you all for your counsel.
14606,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
14607,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,About what?
14608,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,About your father. About the Mad King.
14609,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
14610,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie."
14611,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,Go on.
14612,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
14613,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not my father.
14614,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
14615,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
14616,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,Your Grace.
14617,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,There's a bug.
14618,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
14619,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
14620,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,You don't like it?
14621,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,I want to take a walk.
14622,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
14623,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
14624,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
14625,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
14626,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,The road to Meereen.
14627,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
14628,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,I told you. A ruler.
14629,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
14630,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
14631,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
14632,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,"Still, a man of talent."
14633,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,Managed to kill a lot of people.
14634,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
14635,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
14636,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,Why?
14637,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
14638,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
14639,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,I find us repulsive.
14640,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
14641,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
14642,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Varys,No.
14643,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion Lannister,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
14644,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,Not him.
14645,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Meryn,"Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
14646,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
14647,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Hunters,"Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
14648,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,Take the head.
14649,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Qyburn,"Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
14650,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,Very good.
14651,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Qyburn,Over there will be fine.
14652,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Meryn,You heard the man. Over there.
14653,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,You're the Hand of the King?
14654,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
14655,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mace Tyrell,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
14656,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
14657,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mace,"Oh, Your Grace."
14658,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
14659,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mace,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
14660,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Pycelle,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
14661,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
14662,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Pycelle,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
14663,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
14664,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Pycelle,I must say I cannot see--
14665,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
14666,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
14667,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,The king is very busy at this moment.
14668,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,"He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
14669,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
14670,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
14671,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
14672,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,What mission?
14673,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,That is not your concern as Master of War.
14674,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
14675,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Cersei Lannister,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
14676,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Kevan,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
14677,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
14678,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
14679,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,"Right, very good!"
14680,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
14681,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,"I know ""S""."
14682,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,"You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
14683,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher. Very patient!"
14684,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
14685,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
14686,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,How old were you when you learned to read?
14687,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Three.
14688,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
14689,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
14690,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,"What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
14691,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
14692,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
14693,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
14694,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
14695,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,Did you ever see them?
14696,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Gilly,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
14697,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,What did he do to them in the woods?
14698,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Mother.
14699,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Selyse,Leave us.
14700,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,Your Grace.
14701,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Selyse,You need to stay away from that girl.
14702,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Why?
14703,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Selyse,She's a wildling.
14704,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
14705,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Selyse,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
14706,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shireen,Gilly wouldn't do that.
14707,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Selyse,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
14708,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
14709,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
14710,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,Who then? You?
14711,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,No. Only one of their own.
14712,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
14713,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,The Lord Commander's niece.
14714,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
14715,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
14716,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,That amuses you?
14717,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
14718,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
14719,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Davos,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
14720,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,Most likely.
14721,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Davos,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
14722,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"Unpleasant, I expect."
14723,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
14724,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
14725,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,You can give me the North.
14726,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
14727,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Stannis Baratheon,"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
14728,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
14729,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
14730,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
14731,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,I'm going to refuse him.
14732,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
14733,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jon Snow,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
14734,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Alliser,Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
14735,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Aemon,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
14736,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Janos,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
14737,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Men,"Hear, hear."
14738,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Janos,He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
14739,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Aemon,Is there anyone else?
14740,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Shadow Tower Brother,"Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
14741,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Aemon,"If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
14742,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,Maester Aemon.
14743,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Aemon,Samwell Tarly. Go on.
14744,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Janos,Sam the Slayer.
14745,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Janos,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
14746,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
14747,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Janos,Lies!
14748,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
14749,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
14750,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Sam,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
14751,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Alliser,"I can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
14752,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Aemon,It is time.
14753,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brother,"It appears to be a tie, Maester."
14754,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Brothers,Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
14755,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,You. You!
14756,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,What have you got there?
14757,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,I said--
14758,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Turn around and go. Turn around and go.
14759,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Man,"That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that."
14760,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
14761,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Men,"Quickly, go, go!"
14762,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
14763,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Old Man,You lost this.
14764,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
14765,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaqen Hghar,There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
14766,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Arya Stark,Well who are you then?
14767,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Jaqen Hghar,No one. And that is who a girl must become.
14768,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Harpy,"She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
14769,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,"For you, Mhysa. You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
14770,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
14771,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
14772,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
14773,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,"Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
14774,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
14775,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mosador,and now you are the law!
14776,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,The law is the law. Take him.
14777,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Crowd,Mhysa! Myhsa!
14778,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Hizdahr,She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
14779,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daario,Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.
14780,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.
14781,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Crowd,Brother! Brother!
14782,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,"Mhysa, please! Forgive me!"
14783,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
14784,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Crowd,Mercy! Mercy!
14785,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Mossador,Mhysa...
14786,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Crowd,Mhysa...
14787,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Barristan,"I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace."
14788,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Grey Worm,We all guard tonight.
14789,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,Leave me.
14790,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys Targaryen,Drogon...
14791,2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,End,EPISODE
14792,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Valar morghulis.
14793,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,Valar dohaeris.
14794,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
14795,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,Good.
14796,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
14797,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,"No? Why come, then?"
14798,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
14799,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,"A man teaches a girl. . Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. ."
14800,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,I want to serve. .
14801,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,"A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
14802,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
14803,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
14804,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,Where are they taking him?
14805,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Bystanders,Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
14806,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days."
14807,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,Did I hurt you?
14808,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,No. You were lovely.
14809,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,It all happened so fast.
14810,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,Yes. .
14811,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
14812,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
14813,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
14814,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
14815,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
14816,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
14817,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
14818,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,So strange… Husband.
14819,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"Wife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died."
14820,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
14821,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
14822,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,Do you like to sail?
14823,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,I love to sail.
14824,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"I do, too."
14825,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
14826,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
14827,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
14828,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
14829,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"Well, but I'm a man now."
14830,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.
14831,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,I suppose.
14832,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."
14833,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
14834,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
14835,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
14836,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
14837,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
14838,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
14839,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
14840,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,"I want you to be happy, mother."
14841,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
14842,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tommen Lannister,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
14843,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
14844,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,Mother! . Welcome.
14845,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
14846,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
14847,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
14848,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,You are very sweet.
14849,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
14850,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
14851,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
14852,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. ."
14853,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,I'll leave you to it then. .
14854,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
14855,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,There's no need for such formalities.
14856,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
14857,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Won't that be a lovely day.
14858,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Margaery Tyrell,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
14859,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Remember. Anything you need.
14860,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
14861,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
14862,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
14863,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
14864,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,He left you no choice.
14865,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
14866,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,And?
14867,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
14868,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
14869,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
14870,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
14871,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
14872,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,That's Moat Cailin.
14873,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
14874,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
14875,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,Home.
14876,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,"The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
14877,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,No.
14878,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
14879,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,He did.
14880,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,He serves the Lannisters.
14881,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,For now.
14882,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,I won't go.
14883,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,Winterfell is your home.
14884,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,Not anymore.
14885,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
14886,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
14887,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
14888,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,No!
14889,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,Sansa -
14890,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
14891,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
14892,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,How do we get through there?
14893,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,We don't. We go around. .
14894,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
14895,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
14896,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
14897,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,He hates that nickname.
14898,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
14899,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,"I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
14900,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,He borrowed it?
14901,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
14902,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,As punishment. For both of you.
14903,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
14904,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
14905,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
14906,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
14907,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
14908,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
14909,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,Yes.
14910,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
14911,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,Thank you.
14912,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
14913,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,I suppose that's more important.
14914,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
14915,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,I was.
14916,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
14917,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,He was.
14918,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,But how did you end up serving Renly?
14919,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
14920,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
14921,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
14922,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Podrick,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
14923,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
14924,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,Lord Commander.
14925,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,Your Grace.
14926,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,I'd like to speak alone.
14927,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
14928,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,Very well. . Have you considered my offer?
14929,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
14930,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,Say the word and you will be.
14931,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
14932,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
14933,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
14934,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
14935,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,I can imagine no higher praise.
14936,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
14937,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
14938,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,Are you bored of us already?
14939,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
14940,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
14941,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,And the wildlings?
14942,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
14943,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
14944,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
14945,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
14946,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
14947,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Stannis Baratheon,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
14948,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,"He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
14949,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
14950,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
14951,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,As long as he's ruling them.
14952,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
14953,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
14954,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
14955,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olly,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
14956,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
14957,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olly,"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
14958,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
14959,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,And what needs to be done?
14960,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Davos,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
14961,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,What do you want?
14962,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Waif,Who are you?
14963,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,What?
14964,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Waif,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?"
14965,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,No one.
14966,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,Ow! Cunt!
14967,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Waif,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
14968,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,"I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -"
14969,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,You're about to find out.
14970,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,What are you doing?
14971,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Waif,We were only playing. The game of faces.
14972,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,A girl is not ready.
14973,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Waif,Clearly not.
14974,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,I am ready.
14975,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
14976,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jaqen Hghar,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?"
14977,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Arya Stark,What do we do with them after we wash them?
14978,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Open gates!
14979,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"Lady Sansa, welcome."
14980,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,Lord Bolton.
14981,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?"
14982,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady."
14983,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Woman,I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
14984,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sansa Stark,Thank you.
14985,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Woman,"Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers."
14986,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,Sam. . Maester Aemon?
14987,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sam,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
14988,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
14989,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
14990,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
14991,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,Greyguard is a ruin.
14992,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
14993,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
14994,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sam,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
14995,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
14996,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,"I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
14997,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,Are you refusing to obey my order?
14998,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
14999,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,Take Lord Janos outside.
15000,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"Olly, bring me my sword."
15001,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,"You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken."
15002,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!"
15003,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
15004,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Janos,"I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."
15005,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olyvar,"You have served us well, my son."
15006,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"Thank you, Father."
15007,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olyvar,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
15008,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,The Maiden.
15009,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olyvar,Where is the Maiden?
15010,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,And the Stranger.
15011,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olyvar,"Two is extra, you realize?"
15012,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"Yes, yes."
15013,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Olyvar,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -
15014,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Lancel,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
15015,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,I am the High Septon of the -
15016,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Lancel,You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
15017,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Crowd,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
15018,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Repent!
15019,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Crowd,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
15020,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Shame on you!
15021,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Crowd,Sinner! Sinner!
15022,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh…"
15023,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,It doesn't matter. .
15024,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
15025,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,You were assaulted?
15026,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
15027,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
15028,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Mace,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
15029,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
15030,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
15031,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Pycelle,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
15032,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
15033,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Septon,"Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
15034,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
15035,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Meryn,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
15036,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
15037,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Seven blessings.
15038,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Thank you.
15039,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,Just a little more...
15040,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Woman,Thank you ever so for the soup!
15041,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
15042,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
15043,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Woman,Seven blessings to you.
15044,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,"Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. ."
15045,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Why no shoes?
15046,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
15047,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
15048,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
15049,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,Perhaps they're right.
15050,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
15051,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
15052,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,"Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
15053,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
15054,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Sparrow,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
15055,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
15056,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,Your Grace.
15057,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. ."
15058,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,"At once, Your Grace. ."
15059,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,How's your work coming along?
15060,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,Very well.
15061,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,You've made progress?
15062,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
15063,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Cersei Lannister,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
15064,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Qyburn,"Shh. Easy, friend."
15065,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
15066,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.
15067,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
15068,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
15069,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
15070,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
15071,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Ramsay Bolton,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. ."
15072,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,He seems pleased.
15073,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,Shouldn't he be?
15074,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
15075,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
15076,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
15077,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
15078,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
15079,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,The Queen will be enraged.
15080,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
15081,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
15082,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
15083,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
15084,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
15085,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
15086,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Petyr Baelish,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
15087,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Roose,I'd like to read the reply.
15088,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
15089,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,Volantis is a large city.
15090,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
15091,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
15092,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
15093,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
15094,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,It's a perfectly good face.
15095,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,I'm losing my mind.
15096,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
15097,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf."
15098,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,Slaves.
15099,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
15100,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Priestess,Lord cast your light upon us.
15101,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Crowd,Lord cast your light upon us.
15102,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Priestess,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
15103,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,We should keep moving.
15104,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Crowd,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
15105,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Priestess,I was once as you are now.
15106,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Priestess,"Bought and sold, , scourged and branded..."
15107,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
15108,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Priestess,The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
15109,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
15110,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Priestess,He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
15111,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
15112,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,Come on. Let's find a brothel.
15113,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.
15114,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
15115,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
15116,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,Thank you.
15117,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,Curious... hair. .
15118,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,The mother of dragons!
15119,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
15120,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
15121,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,What makes you worth that much?
15122,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Blonde Prostitute,I'm magic. .
15123,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Man,I bet you bloody are.
15124,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, , she's taken."
15125,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Varys,Where're you going?
15126,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,I need to speak to someone with hair.
15127,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,Hello?
15128,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,Hello.
15129,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,You've got no drink.
15130,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,You've got no money.
15131,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
15132,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
15133,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,That's because they've never met a queen.
15134,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,You're just saying that.
15135,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
15136,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,Why?
15137,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,Because you have a skeptical mind.
15138,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,"Alright, then. I'm warning you. We're gonna have to wash you first."
15139,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Black Haired Prostitute,Come on.
15140,2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."

15220,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Margaery Tyrell,She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
15221,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tommen Lannister,Aren't you and mother getting along?

15280,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sam,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."

15298,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Melisandre,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
15299,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jon Snow,I know. But I still love her.
15300,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Melisandre,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
15301,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Stannis Baratheon,Are you lonely?
15302,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Shireen,Just bored.
15303,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Stannis Baratheon,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
15304,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Shireen,"Were you bored a lot, too?"
15305,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Stannis Baratheon,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
15306,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Shireen,I like it. . I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. .
15307,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Stannis Baratheon,Why do you say that?
15308,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Shireen,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""
15309,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Stannis Baratheon,She shouldn't have said that.
15310,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Shireen,"Are you ashamed of me, father?"
15311,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Stannis Baratheon,"When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
15312,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
15313,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
15314,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
15315,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
15316,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .
15317,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,Dressed for riding?
15318,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,I am.
15319,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,Where are you going?
15320,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,King's Landing.
15321,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,King's Landing?
15322,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
15323,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,You can't leave me here!
15324,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
15325,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,How do you know?
15326,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
15327,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,You don't know that.
15328,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
15329,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
15330,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
15331,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,And if you're right?
15332,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
15333,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
15334,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
15335,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
15336,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
15337,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,I don't know how to do that.
15338,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
15339,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,His father frightens me.
15340,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Petyr Baelish,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
15341,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Sansa Stark,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
15342,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Breakfast.
15343,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,That would have been a shit way to die.
15344,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
15345,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
15346,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
15347,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
15348,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,Sounds like all the rest.
15349,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
15350,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
15351,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
15352,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
15353,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,In the arms of the woman I love.
15354,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,She want the same thing?
15355,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,Let's go.
15356,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
15357,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,Pentoshi.
15358,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,And he's headed to Oldtown?
15359,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,As I said. Why?
15360,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
15361,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,A bag of gold.
15362,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
15363,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,It was a heavy bag.
15364,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
15365,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,How many you count?
15366,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,Four.
15367,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,How many you think you can take?
15368,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,"One, if he's slow."
15369,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,Halt!
15370,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,"Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
15371,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,Who are you?
15372,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Cooper. . This is Darnell.
15373,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,You're from King's Landing.
15374,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
15375,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,Why are you here?
15376,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
15377,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,I thought the sharks would get us. .
15378,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,There are no sharks in Dorne.
15379,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
15380,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Dolphins maybe.
15381,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,Throw your swords in the sand.
15382,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
15383,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Rider,Swords in the sand! Now!
15384,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,That one should be slow enough.
15385,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Nice move! .
15386,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,Luck.
15387,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,You had a wonderful teacher.
15388,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
15389,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,First we need to bury these bodies.
15390,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Birds have to eat too.
15391,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
15392,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Bronn,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
15393,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jaime Lannister,"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
15394,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyene,Nama!
15395,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Elaria,"Nym, Obara."
15396,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Obara,Will it be war?
15397,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Elaria,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
15398,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Obara,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
15399,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Elaria,"We don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
15400,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Nymeria,We may have a problem.
15401,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Obara,"A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
15402,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Elaria,"He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
15403,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyene,I'm with you. Always. .
15404,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Elaria,Nym? . Obara?
15405,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Obara,"When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
15406,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Obara,I made my choice long ago.
15407,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,Thank you. . Who are you?
15408,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jorah Mormont,Your captor.
15409,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,Do you have wine?
15410,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jorah Mormont,No.
15411,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,I can't sleep without wine.
15412,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jorah Mormont,Then stay awake.
15413,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
15414,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jorah Mormont,I'm not taking you to your sister.
15415,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
15416,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jorah Mormont,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
15417,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
15418,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Jorah Mormont,What business would you have with the Queen?
15419,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Tyrion Lannister,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
15420,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
15421,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
15422,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,Why?
15423,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
15424,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,He sang to them?
15425,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
15426,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,And what did you do?
15427,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.
15428,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,He was good?
15429,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
15430,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
15431,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
15432,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,And what did you do with the money?
15433,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Barristan,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. ."
15434,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daario,"Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
15435,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,How many others are there?
15436,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daario,Fifty a hundred.
15437,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
15438,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daario,I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
15439,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."

15441,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Hizdahr,All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
15442,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Missandei,Glory?
15443,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Hizdahr,"Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
15444,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
15445,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Hizdahr,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
15446,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Daenerys Targaryen,I do not recognize this tradition.
15447,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Hizdahr,"Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. . Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."
15448,2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,Woman,Sons of the Harpy.

15450,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,"I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
15451,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
15452,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daario,"We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
15453,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
15454,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,But... I'm the leader of my family.
15455,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,"No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!"
15456,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,Walk forward.
15457,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,You cannot do this.
15458,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,Another step.
15459,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
15460,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,But she does not give up on them.
15461,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide."
15462,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,All men must die.
15463,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
15464,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
15465,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Aemon,"And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
15466,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
15467,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Aemon,"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing."
15468,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,Maester Aemon.
15469,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Aemon,Lord Commander.
15470,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
15471,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,How are you feeling?
15472,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Aemon,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
15473,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
15474,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Aemon,"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
15475,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,But you don't know what it is.
15476,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Aemon,"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."
15477,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
15478,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
15479,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,What about you?
15480,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
15481,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,What if I unchained you?
15482,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,Why would you do that?
15483,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
15484,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
15485,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
15486,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,And now everything is going to change?
15487,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,It is.
15488,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,Why now?
15489,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
15490,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,"What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?"
15491,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
15492,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
15493,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
15494,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
15495,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
15496,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
15497,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
15498,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
15499,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
15500,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,We'll need ships.
15501,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
15502,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tormund,"All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won't be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go."
15503,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,"You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?"
15504,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
15505,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
15506,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,Fewer.
15507,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,What?
15508,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,Nothing.
15509,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
15510,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
15511,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Allister,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
15512,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,And we've slaughtered theirs.
15513,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Edd,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
15514,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
15515,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
15516,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Olly,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
15517,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,It's not a trick.
15518,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Olly,"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
15519,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
15520,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Olly,"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
15521,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,No.
15522,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Podrick,She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
15523,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
15524,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
15525,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,Aye.
15526,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,Did you know Lord Eddard?
15527,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
15528,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
15529,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,Everyone knows. The Boltons.
15530,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
15531,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,Who are you?
15532,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
15533,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,Swore to who?
15534,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,Her mother.
15535,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Man,Her mother's dead.
15536,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Brienne,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
15537,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Come back here. Myranda.
15538,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,I saw you staring at her.
15539,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
15540,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,You said you'd marry me.
15541,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
15542,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,Do you think she's pretty?
15543,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Of course I do. I'm not blind.
15544,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
15545,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,"Perhaps I'll marry, too."
15546,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"
15547,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,Never.
15548,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Woman,"Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin."
15549,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,"Oh, I don't need-"
15550,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Woman,"You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower."
15551,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,But who -
15552,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Woman,You're not alone.
15553,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,I like your dress. Who made it for you?
15554,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,I made it myself.
15555,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,Really?
15556,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,"Who, who are you?"
15557,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
15558,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,My mother. .
15559,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
15560,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,Thank you.
15561,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,"It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
15562,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,I'd rather have a mother.
15563,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,"I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember."
15564,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,Down there at the end.
15565,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,What is it?
15566,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Myranda,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it."
15567,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,Theon?
15568,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,You shouldn't be here.
15569,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
15570,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Do you have something to tell me?
15571,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,"No, my lord."
15572,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Reek.
15573,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,She saw me.
15574,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Who?
15575,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
15576,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,She saw you?
15577,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
15578,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Come here.
15579,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees."
15580,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Give me your hand.
15581,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,I forgive you.
15582,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,"I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
15583,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,"Yes, thank you, my lord."
15584,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Allow me.
15585,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Mother.
15586,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Walda,"Thank you, Ramsay."
15587,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
15588,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,To your wedding.
15589,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Walda,To your wedding.
15590,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Walda,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
15591,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
15592,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please."
15593,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
15594,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,"Yes, master."
15595,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"That's his new name, Reek."
15596,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,Why are you doing this?
15597,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers."
15598,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,I'm sorry.
15599,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
15600,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Sorry about what?
15601,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Theon Greyjoy,For killing your brothers.
15602,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
15603,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,"Yes, yes, very good."
15604,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Wonderful. .
15605,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,"Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
15606,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Walda,We're going to have a baby.
15607,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sansa Stark,I'm very happy for you.
15608,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,"From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy."
15609,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,How can you be sure?
15610,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,Sure of what?
15611,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
15612,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
15613,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,So how did you manage it?
15614,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,Manage what?
15615,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Getting her pregnant.
15616,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
15617,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
15618,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,"You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
15619,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,And if it's a boy?
15620,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,You're worried about your position.
15621,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
15622,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,You've never asked me about your mother.
15623,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
15624,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Roose,"She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
15625,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Ramsay Bolton,Yes.
15626,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,Is this every book there is?
15627,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,Every book there is?
15628,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,In the world.
15629,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
15630,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,"Where you grew up, were there more books?"
15631,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
15632,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,Where's that?
15633,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
15634,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,I'm sorry I don't know things.
15635,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
15636,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
15637,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,Well -
15638,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
15639,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,It's where they train the maesters.
15640,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Gilly,Like Maester Aemon?
15641,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
15642,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"Ah, Your Grace."
15643,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,You're Samwell Tarly?
15644,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"I am, Your Grace."
15645,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
15646,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"I did, Your Grace."
15647,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,How?
15648,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
15649,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,Dragonglass?
15650,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,What the maesters call obsidian -
15651,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
15652,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
15653,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
15654,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
15655,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,Seen what?
15656,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Sam,The army of the dead. And when they come -
15657,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,"We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
15658,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,It's time.
15659,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
15660,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
15661,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
15662,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,"No need, they're coming with us."
15663,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
15664,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
15665,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,"As you wish, Your Grace."
15666,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Shireen,Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
15667,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,Beg your pardon?
15668,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Shireen,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
15669,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
15670,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Shireen,Is there going to be a battle?
15671,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
15672,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Selyse,"That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
15673,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,"Yes, my queen."
15674,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Shireen,I'm not scared.
15675,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Davos,"Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
15676,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Shireen,I promise.
15677,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Stannis Baratheon,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
15678,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jon Snow,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
15679,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,You're still too weak. .
15680,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Grey Worm,How long have I been here?
15681,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,Three days.
15682,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Grey Worm,Ser Barristan?
15683,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Grey Worm,"I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
15684,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,"You failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
15685,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Grey Worm,"This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
15686,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,All men fear death.
15687,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Grey Worm,"No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath."
15688,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
15689,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
15690,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,"Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
15691,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
15692,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Missandei,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see."
15693,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,"My, my queen, please do not do this."
15694,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
15695,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
15696,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
15697,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Hizdahr,"Yes, my queen."
15698,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Daenerys Targaryen,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
15699,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
15700,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,We are.
15701,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
15702,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,No wine.
15703,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
15704,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
15705,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,I am.
15706,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,Have you sailed this route before?
15707,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,No.
15708,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
15709,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,I think you'll be plenty.
15710,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
15711,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,No. But the pirates are.
15712,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,Oh.
15713,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
15714,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,And then they weren't.
15715,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
15716,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
15717,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,I would clap.
15718,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
15719,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,What was that?
15720,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
15721,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,Get behind!
15722,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!"
15723,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,Mormont! Mormont!
15724,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
15725,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
15726,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
15727,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,I suppose that's why they send them there.
15728,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?"
15729,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
15730,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,Without luck?
15731,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Jorah Mormont,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
15732,2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,Tyrion Lannister,That's the best idea you've had all day.
15733,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,What are they doing with the bodies?
15734,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,Get back to work.
15735,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,No! I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.
15736,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,You will know why.
15737,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,When?
15738,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,When it's time. Not before. Get back to work.
15739,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,When do I get to play the game?
15740,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,Game?
15741,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,The game. The game of faces.
15742,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,You tried already. You failed.
15743,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,I didn't even know I was playing.
15744,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,Who are you?
15745,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,No one.
15746,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,Well who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?
15747,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,"I'm from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since."
15748,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,Was that true or a lie?
15749,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,What?
15750,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Waif,Did you believe every word I said?
15751,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,Who are you?
15752,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,Arya.
15753,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,And where did you come from?
15754,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
15755,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,A lie.
15756,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
15757,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
15758,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."
15759,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,I hated him.
15760,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,I hated him!
15761,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,That's not a lie!
15762,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
15763,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,Yes.
15764,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
15765,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,We never stop playing.
15766,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots."
15767,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,I can.
15768,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,You're not hungry?
15769,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Of course I'm hungry.
15770,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
15771,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,I am not your travelling companion.
15772,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…
15773,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Do you ever shut up?
15774,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
15775,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Why?
15776,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
15777,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.
15778,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
15779,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
15780,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,What do you know about my father?
15781,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
15782,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.
15783,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,How?
15784,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,I only know what I heard
15785,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
15786,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,We better keep moving.
15787,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Man,Valar morghulis.
15788,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,Valar dohaeris.
15789,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Man,I have nowhere else to go. I've taken her to every healer in Braavos. I've spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
15790,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Girl,It hurts.
15791,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,"I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
15792,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Arya Stark,I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.
15793,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"
15794,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaqen Hghar,No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
15795,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."
15796,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Do you believe in anything?
15797,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,I believe in many things.
15798,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
15799,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,No.
15800,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
15801,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
15802,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
15803,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,No it doesn't.
15804,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
15805,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,First we have to conquer the world.
15806,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
15807,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Then she rules.
15808,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
15809,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,She is the rightful heir.
15810,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
15811,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship
15812,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,Why is it anchored?
15813,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,They probably came ashore for--
15814,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,water.
15815,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sam Tarly,PLACE - LATER
15816,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"
15817,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Slaver,Salt mines.
15818,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
15819,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Slaver,What about the dwarf?
15820,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,Worthless. Cut his throat.
15821,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!"
15822,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
15823,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
15824,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Slaver,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
15825,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,Guess again.
15826,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
15827,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
15828,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,"We're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
15829,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
15830,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,Him.
15831,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.
15832,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
15833,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,Is that true?
15834,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
15835,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Tyrion Lannister,The Kingslayer!
15836,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
15837,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
15838,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Malko,Liar.
15839,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jorah Mormont,"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth."
15840,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Lancel,Lord Baelish.
15841,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Yes? Lancel Lannister.
15842,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Lancel,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
15843,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,That's quite a family to abandon.
15844,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Lancel,"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
15845,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Well done.
15846,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
15847,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Lancel,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing."
15848,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
15849,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
15850,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
15851,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
15852,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
15853,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
15854,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
15855,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
15856,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
15857,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
15858,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
15859,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
15860,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
15861,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
15862,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.
15863,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
15864,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,That's not possible.
15865,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
15866,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
15867,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
15868,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
15869,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
15870,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
15871,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
15872,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
15873,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
15874,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
15875,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
15876,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
15877,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"Ser Jaime, then."
15878,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
15879,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
15880,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
15881,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
15882,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,And if you succeed?
15883,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,Name me Warden of the North.
15884,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
15885,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
15886,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
15887,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Petyr Baelish,As I said. I live to serve.
15888,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
15889,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,What if he says no?
15890,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
15891,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…"
15892,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,We can't. Not yet.
15893,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,Why not?
15894,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,You know why not. Someone will see.
15895,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
15896,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
15897,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.
15898,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,"They don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."
15899,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Doran,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
15900,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Areo,"Yes, my prince."
15901,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Doran,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
15902,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Areo,I remember how.
15903,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
15904,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,"Alright, thats enough."
15905,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,I'm coming to the best part.
15906,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
15907,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,This song really is all about the ending.
15908,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,It can wait. Up there.
15909,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,That's the Water Gardens.
15910,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
15911,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,I like to improvise.
15912,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,That explains the golden hand.
15913,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Ellaria,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
15914,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sand Snakes,For Oberyn.
15915,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,"Well, she's made herself at home."
15916,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,Myrcella.
15917,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,"Uncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?"
15918,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,Let's speak in private.
15919,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,I am Trystane Martell.
15920,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,Trystane is my intended.
15921,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,Excellent. Good to meet you.
15922,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Trystane,"We weren't expecting you, Ser Jaime."
15923,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
15924,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,Let's not do something stupid.
15925,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,No!
15926,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,That was something stupid.
15927,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
15928,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,You hurt him!
15929,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Jaime Lannister,"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
15930,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,Oh for fuck's sake.
15931,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Obara,You're coming with me.
15932,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myrcella,I don't want to!
15933,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Obara,"I wasn't asking, princess."
15934,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Areo,Drop you weapons!
15935,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Obara,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
15936,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Areo,Drop your weapons!
15937,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Areo,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight."
15938,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Bronn,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
15939,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Rider,Halt!
15940,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
15941,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
15942,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
15943,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
15944,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,But he was the king's brother.
15945,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
15946,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,Cersei is behind this.
15947,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
15948,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
15949,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,You must be exhausted.
15950,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
15951,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
15952,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
15953,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,Beg your pardon.
15954,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
15955,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
15956,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
15957,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
15958,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
15959,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
15960,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
15961,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
15962,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,What veil?
15963,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
15964,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
15965,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
15966,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
15967,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,I don't pay attention to rumors.
15968,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in"
15969,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,He was my friend. He was my king.
15970,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,"Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
15971,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
15972,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Wearing Renly's armor.
15973,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,Why does it matter what I wore?
15974,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
15975,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,Of course I deny them.
15976,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
15977,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,Never.
15978,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Nor any other man.
15979,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,That will be all Ser Loras.
15980,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,Well I think that's quite enough of that.
15981,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
15982,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,You call me forward?
15983,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Yes. We have some questions for you.
15984,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,I am the queen.
15985,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,"You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
15986,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
15987,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,They are lies.
15988,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,All of them?
15989,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,All of them.
15990,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
15991,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,"Yes, I swear it."
15992,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,"Thank you, your grace."
15993,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Do you know this man?
15994,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olyvar,"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
15995,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,How did you come to meet?
15996,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olyvar,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
15997,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,And what occurred in his chamber?
15998,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olyvar,We engaged in intimate relations.
15999,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,You laid with him?
16000,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olyvar,That night and many others.
16001,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,Liar! He's a liar!
16002,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
16003,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olyvar,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised."
16004,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Cersei Lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
16005,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olyvar,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
16006,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Loras,Liar!
16007,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Olenna Tyrell,What are you doing? Let us pass.
16008,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
16009,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,What?
16010,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sparrow,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
16011,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,Tommen! Tommen!
16012,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Margaery Tyrell,"You can't do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!"
16013,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sansa Stark,What do you want?
16014,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myranda,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?"
16015,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myranda,"You're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
16016,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Sansa Stark,What others?
16017,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myranda,I shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
16018,2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Myranda,"Let's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."

We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It's far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.
16109,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Davos,40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.

16130,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Melisandre,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.
16131,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Melisandre,But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

16136,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Stannis Baratheon,There must be another way. Leeches or something.
16137,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Melisandre,There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.

16175,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Gilly,"Don't be stupid Sam, you're not a fighter."
16176,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sam,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
16177,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Gilly,Just promise me that whatever happens you'll take care of little Sam.
16178,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sam,"Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too."
16179,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Gilly,I need more water.
16180,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sam,Stay. Please.
16181,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Gilly,Am I hurting you?
16182,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Gilly,Are you sure?
16183,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sam,Oh. Oh my.
16184,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Malko,"A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors."
16185,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Malko,13. Do I have 14?
16186,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Malko,15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?
16187,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Slave Buyer,20.
16188,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Malko,Sold!
16189,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
16190,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Buyer,Why?
16191,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
16192,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Malko,He's funny. You have to give him that.
16193,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Buyer,Alright. He's funny.
16194,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
16195,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Buyer,Yes.
16196,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,"My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
16197,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Buer,"Here's your wages, funny man. It'll last the rest of your life."
16198,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
16199,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
16200,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
16201,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,Are you jealous?
16202,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,Do you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
16203,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,I do.
16204,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,You're right. My motivations are entirely impure.
16205,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,Doesn't make me wrong.
16206,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,"You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
16207,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
16208,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,So what else can I do?
16209,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,Marry me instead.
16210,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't."
16211,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,"Why not? You're our queen, you can do as you like."
16212,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,No. I can't
16213,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,Then you are the only person in Mereen who's not free.
16214,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,"I know I'm here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
16215,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,Of course
16216,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,"On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
16217,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
16218,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daario,All rulers are either butchers or meat.
16219,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got."
16220,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit."
16221,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
16222,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
16223,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,Don't spar with me little fellow.
16224,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"For me, it's the knees. You?"
16225,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,Hips.
16226,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Huh.
16227,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."
16228,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,The people always do the dirty work.
16229,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
16230,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,A useful talent.
16231,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
16232,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
16233,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,Don't you walk away from me.
16234,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna."
16235,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
16236,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,What then?
16237,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth"
16238,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
16239,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don't have one in your library I'll give you my own.
16240,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,I've read the seven pointed star.
16241,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
16242,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
16243,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Yes. The Gods' laws must be applied to all equally.
16244,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
16245,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"
16246,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Squire,Lady Olenna.
16247,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
16248,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tommen Lannister,She's in a prison cell and there's nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there's nothing I can do!
16249,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
16250,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tommen Lannister,I'll call in the army. I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I'll start a war if I have to.
16251,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
16252,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tommen Lannister,I love her. I love her. I can't help her.
16253,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
16254,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tommen Lannister,I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
16255,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
16256,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Your happiness is all I want in this world
16257,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tommen Lannister,I know.
16258,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
16259,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Areo,Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing.
16260,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Myrcella,You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
16261,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Jaime Lannister,And more hands. How's Trystane?
16262,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Myrcella,He'll be alright.
16263,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Jaime Lannister,I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
16264,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Myrcella,Why is it happening at all?
16265,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Jaime Lannister,Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
16266,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Myrcella,"This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?"
16267,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Jaime Lannister,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
16268,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Myrcella,"It's not complicated at all, it's simple. I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here."
16269,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Jaime Lannister,I don't understand.
16270,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Myrcella,Of course you don't! You don't know me!
16271,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,"Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!"
16272,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,He's got a good voice.
16273,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Obara,We're lucky he's a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
16274,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,It's against my code to hurt a woman.
16275,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Obara,It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
16276,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,I wouldn't say you beat me.
16277,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,How's your arm?
16278,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
16279,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,You think you're leaving Dorne?
16280,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
16281,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,Thank you.
16282,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.
16283,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
16284,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
16285,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,Name one more beautiful than I am.
16286,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,"Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
16287,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.
16288,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,Was I?
16289,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,There was a woman more beautiful than I am.
16290,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
16291,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,How's your arm now?
16292,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
16293,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,And how about your head?
16294,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
16295,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,Your nose is bleeding.
16296,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,It's nothing. It's the dry air.
16297,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,"My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
16298,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?
16299,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,Sorry? Who?
16300,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Bronn,You.
16301,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,Don't drop it.
16302,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyene,I think you're very handsome as well.
16303,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,I'm sorry about the locale.
16304,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,No you're not.
16305,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,It felt like the safest place.
16306,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
16307,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
16308,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
16309,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
16310,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
16311,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,I promise you..
16312,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
16313,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
16314,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,And what did she want?
16315,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
16316,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Olenna Tyrell,What kind of gift?
16317,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Petyr Baelish,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
16318,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Slave Owner,"Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."
16319,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Owner,"You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."
16320,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Owner,Valar morghulis.
16321,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Men,Valar dohaeris.
16322,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Owner,Prepare yourselves.
16323,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
16324,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Hizdahr,"For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."
16325,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Owner,Move yourselves!
16326,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Owner,Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.
16327,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Owner,"We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16328,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Men,"We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
16329,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,I think I've seen enough.
16330,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Hizdahr,"Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
16331,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
16332,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,What are you doing?
16333,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,Get him out of my sight.
16334,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Jorah Mormont,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
16335,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,It's true. He has.
16336,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Daenerys Targaryen,Who are you?
16337,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Tyrion Lannister,"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
16338,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
16339,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Margaery Tyrell,I know you did this.
16340,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
16341,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Margaery Tyrell,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
16342,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
16343,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Margaery Tyrell,I don't want to see you again.
16344,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
16345,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Margaery Tyrell,Leave.
16346,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
16347,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Margaery Tyrell,Get out you hateful bitch!
16348,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,"Sleep well, sister."
16349,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Thank you. You saw her?
16350,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Yes.
16351,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,And?
16352,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
16353,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
16354,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Who will stand judge?
16355,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
16356,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Will you be one of them?
16357,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,I will.
16358,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
16359,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.
16360,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,What does The Mother's mercy entail?
16361,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
16362,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
16363,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?
16364,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,I think I may have heard at one point.
16365,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
16366,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,Who carved this altar do you know?
16367,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,I'm afraid i don't.
16368,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
16369,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,"A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
16370,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Sparrow,And he has much to say about you.
16371,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Move. Let me go immediately.
16372,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
16373,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,Cersei Lannister,Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
16374,2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,End,EPISODE
16375,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jorah Mormont,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
16376,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
16377,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,If only I were otherwise.
16378,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
16379,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
16380,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
16381,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
16382,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
16383,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
16384,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
16385,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
16386,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
16387,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
16388,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
16389,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,I know.
16390,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
16391,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
16392,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
16393,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, many opportunities."
16394,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,And did he?
16395,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,No. Not until forced to do so.
16396,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
16397,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,So I should kill him?
16398,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
16399,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
16400,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Septa,Confess.
16401,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,My son. Let me speak to--
16402,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Septa,Confess. I meant it.
16403,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,My face will be the last thing you see before--
16404,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,"My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
16405,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
16406,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
16407,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
16408,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,How will she serve him?
16409,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
16410,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,What will she do there?
16411,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,She will see.
16412,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,See what?
16413,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
16414,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
16415,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
16416,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Thin Man,Your oysters fresh?
16417,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,Best in the city.
16418,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Thin Man,You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?
16419,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Thin Man,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.
16420,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Man,It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
16421,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Thin Man,Can't do it.
16422,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Man,"Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?"
16423,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
16424,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
16425,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
16426,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
16427,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
16428,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
16429,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
16430,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Arya Stark,And then what?
16431,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,A gift for the Thin Man.
16432,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Waif,She is not ready.
16433,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not."
16434,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Waif,And if she's not?
16435,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jaqen Hghar,It is all the same to the Many Faced God.
16436,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
16437,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,The charges?
16438,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,"Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
16439,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,All lies.
16440,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,"Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
16441,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
16442,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,"I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
16443,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,Tell him I need to speak to him.
16444,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,I implored him to visit you but he would not.
16445,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
16446,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,"Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
16447,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
16448,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,"I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone."
16449,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,I can't stay here.
16450,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,"There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
16451,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
16452,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Qyburn,Goodbye my queen. The work continues.
16453,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,Why. Why Theon.
16454,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
16455,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
16456,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
16457,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,"Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
16458,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
16459,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,"They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
16460,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,They weren't. They were only--
16461,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,Only what?
16462,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,I can't..
16463,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,Tell me!
16464,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,"I can't, not unless the master says..."
16465,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,"Tell me, they weren't what?!"
16466,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,They weren't...
16467,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,"Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
16468,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
16469,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,You didn't…?
16470,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
16471,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,I can't talk to you anymore.
16472,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sansa Stark,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
16473,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Theon Greyjoy,"Not Theon, Reek!"
16474,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Bolton Bannerman,"Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
16475,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Roose,"And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
16476,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Roose,You disagree?
16477,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Ramsay Bolton,"Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
16478,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Roose,And what do you recommend?
16479,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Ramsay Bolton,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
16480,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Roose,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.
16481,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Ramsay Bolton,I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.
16482,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
16483,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
16484,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,It's probably my safest option.
16485,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
16486,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,And what would your father do?
16487,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
16488,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Is that why you killed him?
16489,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
16490,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
16491,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
16492,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm terrible?
16493,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,I've heard stories.
16494,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
16495,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
16496,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Which kind is that?
16497,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
16498,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
16499,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
16500,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Perhaps it won't come to that.
16501,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
16502,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Varys? King Robert's spy master?
16503,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
16504,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
16505,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
16506,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,But you trust him?
16507,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
16508,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,The brother who killed my father.
16509,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,That's the one.
16510,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
16511,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
16512,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not going to kill you.
16513,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,No? Banish me?
16514,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,No.
16515,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
16516,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
16517,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,Advise you on what?
16518,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,How to get what I want.
16519,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
16520,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
16521,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
16522,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
16523,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
16524,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,The common people.
16525,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
16526,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
16527,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tyrion Lannister,It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
16528,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
16529,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jorah Mormont,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
16530,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Master,You struck me.
16531,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jorah Mormont,I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
16532,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Master,"You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
16533,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jorah Mormont,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
16534,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Septa,Thirsty? Confess.
16535,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
16536,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
16537,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Cersei Lannister,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
16538,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Gilly,Does it hurt?
16539,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,No.
16540,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Gilly,Good.
16541,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,How are you?
16542,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Gilly,I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
16543,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,You know what I mean.
16544,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Gilly,I'm good.
16545,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Are you scared?
16546,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Gilly,A little.
16547,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Me too.
16548,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Who's there?
16549,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,Olly.
16550,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Come in.
16551,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,I heard what happened.
16552,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
16553,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,Figured you were hungry.
16554,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,You're a good lad.
16555,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.
16556,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Gilly,I need to check on baby Sam.
16557,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Now then. How can I help?
16558,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,It's about the Lord Commander.
16559,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Yes?
16560,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
16561,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,We've been fighting them for years.
16562,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?
16563,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
16564,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,"The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
16565,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Olly...
16566,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,How can he trust him?
16567,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
16568,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
16569,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
16570,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Olly,You believe that?
16571,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,With all my heart.
16572,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Sam,Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
16573,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,You trust me Jon Snow?
16574,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Does that make me a fool?
16575,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,We are fools together now.
16576,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
16577,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
16578,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,War.
16579,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
16580,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
16581,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,You don't give the orders here.
16582,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,I'm not giving an order.
16583,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,Why aren't you in chains?
16584,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,He's not my prisoner.
16585,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,What is he?
16586,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,We're allies.
16587,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
16588,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,I don't fight for the crows.
16589,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
16590,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Lord Of Bones,"Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
16591,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,Gather the elders and let's talk.
16592,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
16593,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,You built that wall to keep us out.
16594,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
16595,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
16596,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
16597,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
16598,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
16599,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,You saw this?
16600,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,No. But I trust the man.
16601,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
16602,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
16603,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?
16604,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
16605,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,Come with you where?
16606,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
16607,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
16608,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,If…?
16609,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
16610,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,Where is Mance?
16611,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,He died.
16612,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,How?
16613,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,I put an arrow through his heart.
16614,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
16615,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today"
16616,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
16617,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
16618,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
16619,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,"He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
16620,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
16621,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead."
16622,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,This is the way.
16623,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Wildling Elder,I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.
16624,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Giant,Tormund.
16625,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,"Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
16626,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,I fucking hate Thenns.
16627,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,How many are with us? 5000?
16628,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,I'm not good at counting.
16629,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,We're leaving too many behind.
16630,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
16631,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,And he knew them better than I ever will.
16632,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.
16633,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,"Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her."
16634,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Daughter,I wanna go with you.
16635,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,"I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on."
16636,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Wun Wun,Lokh kif rukh?
16637,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,Shut the gate.
16638,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,Shut the gate!!
16639,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Shouting,Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
16640,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,Ready your arrows!
16641,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Get in line! Get in line!
16642,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Hold the line! Hold the line!
16643,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Nights Watch Brother,Lord Commander!
16644,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
16645,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Brother,But you'll never make it--
16646,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Now!
16647,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,You should be on one of those boats.
16648,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?
16649,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,You have my word. I've given orders.
16650,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Karsi,Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !
16651,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,"If they get through, everyone dies !"
16652,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
16653,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,The Dragonglass!
16654,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,"You're with me, lad! Now!"
16655,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Loboda,Get the glass.
16656,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Edd,Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.
16657,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Go! Go! Go!
16658,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Tormund,"Wun Wun, to the sea."
16659,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,Jon Snow,Let's go now! Now!
16660,2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,End,EPISODE
16661,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
16662,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,Horses?
16663,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
16664,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
16665,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
16666,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,"Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
16667,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
16668,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,We're not returning to Castle Black.
16669,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…"
16670,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
16671,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Alliser,Open the gates.
16672,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jon Snow,It was a failure.
16673,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Sam,It wasn't.
16674,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jon Snow,"I went to save them, I failed."
16675,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Sam,"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
16676,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jon Snow,I don't think that fact's lost on them.
16677,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Alliser,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed."
16678,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
16679,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
16680,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"Your Grace, you've named me your Hand."
16681,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,Yes.
16682,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
16683,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,"You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command."
16684,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
16685,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed."
16686,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
16687,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,My family stays with me.
16688,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
16689,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,What's this one now?
16690,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,The Dance of Dragons
16691,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,Well that sounds like a proper story.
16692,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
16693,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
16694,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,And burnt him to a crisp.
16695,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
16696,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,Do you like it?
16697,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,He's beautiful.
16698,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,Thank you.
16699,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,You're very welcome.
16700,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
16701,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,Of course I will.
16702,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,But why am I getting a present?
16703,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Davos,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
16704,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,You'll just have to read it yourself.
16705,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,Prince Doran.
16706,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
16707,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,Princess Myrcella.
16708,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Myrcella,Uncle.
16709,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,What a lovely dress.
16710,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Myrcella,You don't like it?
16711,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,You must be cold.
16712,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Myrcella,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
16713,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?
16714,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Trystane,A fleabite.
16715,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,What are you doing in Dorne?
16716,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
16717,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
16718,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
16719,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Myrcella,That necklace was stolen from my room.
16720,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
16721,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,We can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.
16722,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
16723,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
16724,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?
16725,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,I'm afraid he does.
16726,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"I cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
16727,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,I accept.
16728,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
16729,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,You have my word.
16730,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,The word of a Kingslayer.
16731,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.
16732,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't."
16733,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
16734,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
16735,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
16736,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.
16737,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Trystane,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
16738,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,You're a good man.
16739,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Trystane,On one condition.
16740,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Nymeria,"Why do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
16741,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyene,You're going to miss.
16742,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Nymeria,I never miss.
16743,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyene,You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. “What if she's right?”
16744,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Nymeria,Luck.
16745,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyene,Now it's my turn.
16746,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Nymeria,You're too slow. You've always been too slow.
16747,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Bronn,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
16748,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Areo,You'll find out very soon.
16749,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyene,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
16750,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Bronn,The most beautiful woman in the world.
16751,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyene,And that's the truth!
16752,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Nymeria,Slut.
16753,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
16754,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Bronn,Only the one.
16755,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
16756,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Bronn,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
16757,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
16758,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Bronn,I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
16759,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,There was one condition.
16760,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,Perhaps some soup instead?
16761,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Arya Stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
16762,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,How much for your little clam?
16763,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Arya Stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
16764,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Thin Man,Come on.
16765,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Thin Man,"Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
16766,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
16767,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
16768,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
16769,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way."
16770,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,I'm afraid I don't partake.
16771,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
16772,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
16773,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
16774,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
16775,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
16776,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
16777,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
16778,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
16779,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
16780,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Banker,I don't have that gift.
16781,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Mace,"It's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
16782,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
16783,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,"It wasn't bad, though."
16784,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king."
16785,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,"This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
16786,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,You're buying?
16787,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,"Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing."
16788,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Brothel Keeper,Sell your fish somewhere else.
16789,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Prostitute,"Oh let her in, Brusco, I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness."
16790,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Prostitute,They say oyster's get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen.
16791,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Arya Stark,Three coppers.
16792,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jon Snow,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
16793,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,Too old.
16794,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Head Prostitute,Brea.
16795,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Head,"I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you."
16796,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,Do you have what I want or not?
16797,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Head,Of course. Of course.
16798,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,"Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry."
16799,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
16800,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,I'll have one.
16801,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Head,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
16802,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,Good.
16803,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,I'll tell you when we're done.
16804,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Meryn,You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
16805,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Head,Of course.
16806,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Head,"I'll have you whipped, girl! Go on!"
16807,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Man,Valaar morghulis.
16808,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaqen Hghar,And?
16809,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Arya Stark,The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.
16810,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaqen Hghar,Perhaps that's why the man is thin.
16811,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Arya Stark,Tomorrow.
16812,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaqen Hghar,Tomorrow.
16813,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaqen Hghar,A girl has work to do.
16814,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,"Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
16815,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Doran,I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.
16816,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,You write like a 7 year old.
16817,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
16818,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,He didn't try to make you pay?
16819,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home
16820,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,She will.
16821,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,"You love her very much, don't you?"
16822,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jaime Lannister,"Of course, she's my niece."
16823,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,I wasn't talking about her.
16824,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
16825,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Ellaria,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
16826,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,Father. Aren't you cold?
16827,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,No. What are you reading?
16828,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,The Dance of Dragons.
16829,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,What's it about?
16830,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
16831,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
16832,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,That's just what they call it.
16833,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,Doesn't make much sense.
16834,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,I think it's poetic.
16835,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
16836,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
16837,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
16838,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"It's alright, father."
16839,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,You don't even know what I'm talking about.
16840,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
16841,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,Yes there is.
16842,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Good, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter."
16843,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,Forgive me.
16844,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,Where's my father? I want to see my father.
16845,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Melisandre,"It will all be over soon, Princess."
16846,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Where's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!"
16847,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
16848,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Selyse,It's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.
16849,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Melisandre,"The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
16850,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Selyse,"If we don't act then we'll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
16851,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Melisandre,"Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
16852,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
16853,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Selyse,I can't.
16854,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon,There's no other way. She has King's blood.
16855,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Melisandre,"Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
16856,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen,"Mother, don't do this please! Please help! Don't do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
16857,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Selyse,No...
16858,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,Where have you been?
16859,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,Just making sure everything's in order.
16860,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Announcer,"Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"
16861,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Announcer,"My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph"
16862,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Quick,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
16863,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Strong,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
16864,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,They're waiting for you. Clap your hands.
16865,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daario,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that's where you should put your money."
16866,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,The smaller man it is.
16867,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not putting my money anywhere.
16868,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
16869,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daario,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
16870,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
16871,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
16872,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daario,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
16873,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,You don't approve?
16874,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
16875,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,"Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
16876,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
16877,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
16878,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,That is greatness?
16879,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
16880,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,My father would have liked you.
16881,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Announcer,We ask again
16882,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
16883,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,At your command?
16884,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,If need be.
16885,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Announcer,A Meereenese champion?
16886,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,How many people will die to make this happen?
16887,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
16888,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,Those men think they're dying for a good reason.
16889,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,Someone else's reason.
16890,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do."
16891,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,"Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
16892,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Announcer,or a Westerosi Knight?!
16893,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jorah Mormont,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
16894,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,Your Grace--
16895,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daario,Shut your mouth.
16896,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,You can end this.
16897,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,She cannot.
16898,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,You can!
16899,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daario,Protect your queen!
16900,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Hizdahr,"Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--"
16901,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Tyrion Lannister,Stay close!
16902,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Jorah Mormont,This way!
16903,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daario,"The other side, follow me!"
16904,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,Drogon!
16905,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,Daenerys Targaryen,Valahd..
16906,2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,End,EPISODE
16907,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Melisandre,"The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
16908,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,We ride for Winterfell.
16909,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Melisandre,And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
16910,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Soldier,Your Grace.
16911,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Prepare to form up.
16912,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Tell me.
16913,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Soldier,The men. Many deserted before dawn.
16914,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,How many?
16915,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Soldier,"Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."
16916,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Soldier,Your Grace?
16917,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.
16918,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Cut her down.
16919,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Soldier,Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
16920,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
16921,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
16922,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,So what are you gonna do?
16923,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
16924,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,But… the Dragonglass?
16925,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
16926,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,But… you killed a White Walker.
16927,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
16928,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
16929,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
16930,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
16931,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
16932,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,What?
16933,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
16934,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
16935,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,"Well, there's Edd."
16936,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,"I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
16937,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,"If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
16938,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,Thank you.
16939,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
16940,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,They'll bloody try.
16941,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,Sam?
16942,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,What?
16943,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,Sam…
16944,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
16945,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,Very carefully.
16946,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.
16947,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,I'll come back.
16948,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,To your return.
16949,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sam,To my return.
16950,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Podrick,My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
16951,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Brienne,How do you know it's Stannis?
16952,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Podrick,He's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.
16953,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
16954,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Soldier,"There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace."
16955,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,Bolton has women fighting for him.
16956,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Brienne,I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
16957,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,I did.
16958,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Brienne,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
16959,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Stannis Baratheon,"Go on, do your duty."
16960,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Ramsay Bolton,Looks like we're done here.
16961,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Survivor,I surrender. I surrender!
16962,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Ramsay Bolton,And I accept your surrender.
16963,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Ramsay Bolton,Let's head back. My wife must be lonely.
16964,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myranda,My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
16965,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Theon Greyjoy,Go with her. Please.
16966,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sansa Stark,"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left."
16967,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myranda,"Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?"
16968,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myranda,You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.
16969,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myranda,Stop! Stop!
16970,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Man,Open the gates!
16971,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Theon Greyjoy,He's coming back.
16972,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Meryn,I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
16973,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
16974,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,I can't hear you.
16975,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.
16976,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,Do you know who you are?
16977,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,You're no one. You're nothing.
16978,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
16979,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Waif,I was right about her.
16980,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,You were.
16981,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Waif,You're not ready. Not at all.
16982,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,That man's life wasn't yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
16983,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,Only death can pay for life.
16984,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,"No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!"
16985,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Waif,Why are you crying?
16986,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,He was my friend.
16987,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Waif,No he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?
16988,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,He was no one.
16989,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,But if you're… Who's this?
16990,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
16991,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,The faces are for no one.
16992,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,You are still someone.
16993,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,And to someone…
16994,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaqen Hghar,the faces are as good as poison.
16995,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,I can't see!
16996,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Arya Stark,What's happening?! What's happening?!
16997,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Doran,I wish you a safe journey home.
16998,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,Thank you.
16999,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Ellaria,Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
17000,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Bronn,Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
17001,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyene,Maybe I'll come visit you.
17002,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Bronn,Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.
17003,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyene,"You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy."
17004,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,"Whenever you're ready, My Lord."
17005,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,Try not to lose it this time.
17006,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,I'll never take it off again.
17007,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
17008,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,Do you think mother will like him.
17009,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
17010,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,And you really believe that?
17011,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
17012,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,She likes you.
17013,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,"I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
17014,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,No you don't.
17015,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…
17016,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,I know what you're trying to say.
17017,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,No. I'm afraid you don't.
17018,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,I do.
17019,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Myrcella,I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father.
17020,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,Myrcella?
17021,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,Myrcella?!
17022,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jaime Lannister,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
17023,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
17024,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,Does he always talk so much?
17025,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Grey Worm,Jorah the Andal.
17026,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,Torgo Nudho.
17027,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Grey Worm,You should not be here.
17028,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,"No, but he is."
17029,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Grey Worm,Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
17030,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,Our queen would be dead if not for him.
17031,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Missandei,It's true. And I would be dead if not for the… little man.
17032,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
17033,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Missandei,A bit “rusty”.
17034,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,Rusty” Thank you.
17035,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Grey Worm,I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
17036,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,You missed a good scrap.
17037,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
17038,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go."
17039,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
17040,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,And I intend to help her do it.
17041,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
17042,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,You betrayed her!
17043,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,Careful now.
17044,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
17045,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,The second time thanks to you.
17046,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
17047,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,"He's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her."
17048,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
17049,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
17050,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,"Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
17051,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,Pardon me?
17052,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
17053,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
17054,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,Can you fight?
17055,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
17056,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,Are you good on a horse?
17057,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,Middling.
17058,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,So mainly you talk?
17059,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,And drink. I've survived so far.
17060,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,"Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
17061,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jorah Mormont,He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
17062,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.
17063,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Grey Worm,I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.
17064,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Missandei,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
17065,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Grey Worm,I am.
17066,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,"He is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
17067,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Missandei,"It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
17068,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daario,"And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
17069,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Voice,"Hello, old friend."
17070,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Varys,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
17071,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
17072,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Varys,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
17073,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
17074,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Varys,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
17075,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
17076,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Varys,"If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
17077,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Tyrion Lannister,I did miss you.
17078,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Varys,"Oh, I know."
17079,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daenerys Targaryen,We have to go home.
17080,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daenerys Targaryen,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
17081,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daenerys Targaryen,How far did you carry me?
17082,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daenerys Targaryen,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
17083,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
17084,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Septa,Confess. Confess.
17085,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
17086,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,You wish to make a confession?
17087,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,"Once I've confessed, will I be free?"
17088,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
17089,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
17090,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,Name him.
17091,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,Lancel Lannister.

17102,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,I do.
17103,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
17104,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
17105,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,"Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
17106,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,Trial? I have confessed?
17107,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
17108,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Cersei Lannister,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.
17109,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,"You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."

17117,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Sparrow,"A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement."

17125,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Davos,He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
17126,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
17127,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Davos,The wildlings will make a difference!
17128,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
17129,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Davos,"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
17130,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,It's not their fight!

17137,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Jon Snow,He could be lying.
17138,2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,Alliser,Could be. There are ways to find out.

17749,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,"I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
17750,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Vala,"Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son"
17751,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,"Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem"
17752,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Vala,"If I tell you anything, they'll kill me So either you kill me or they do"
17753,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again"
17754,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
17755,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
17756,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
17757,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?"
17758,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Grey Worm,Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol
17759,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,That's good That's very good
17760,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
17761,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,Who said this?
17762,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game"
17763,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
17764,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Grey Worm,Games are for children
17765,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games
17766,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"There, that's a start"
17767,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,Only the girls
17768,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games"
17769,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,We do not drink
17770,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,Until you do
17771,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking"
17772,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, you took your time"
17773,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush
17774,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,You found out?
17775,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
17776,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
17777,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Grey Worm,We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters
17778,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
17779,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Grey Worm,"If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
17780,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,"We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear"
17781,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,You may be right
17782,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Grey Worm,So we will fight them?
17783,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,Possibly
17784,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Missandei,Possibly?
17785,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,It's a conversation
17786,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tyrion Lannister,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis"
17787,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Varys,"Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust"
17788,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Qyburn,"Your eye looks much better, Arthur How's your mother's jaw?"
17789,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Arthur,Better

17796,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Arthur,He called us his little birds He gave us sweets
17797,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Qyburn,It's funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne
17798,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Qyburn,"Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers"
17799,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Qyburn,No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He's friends with all my friends

17805,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Jaime Lannister,"Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place"
17806,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Qyburn,He understands well enough
17807,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Jaime Lannister,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon
17808,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Cersei Lannister,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one

17823,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Cersei Lannister,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
17824,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Maester Pycelle,"Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently"
17825,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Cersei Lannister,"What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"

17833,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,When she's fully atoned for her sins
17834,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tommen Lannister,You've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn't a full atonement?
17835,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,"No She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins"
17836,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tommen Lannister,I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place

17841,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tommen Lannister,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?
17842,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,"How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn't come from this world But you know that You've felt it You've seen her when she talks to you"

17847,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,"When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you"
17848,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Tommen Lannister,I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured
17849,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,It's not what I want It's what the gods want They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it
17850,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,Please
17851,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Sparrow,"If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods"

17869,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Arya Stark,She did and she did not
17870,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Waif,She sounds confused
17871,2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,Arya Stark,"Yes, she was"

18013,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
18014,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,I don't make peace with the queen's enemies I kill the queen's enemies
18015,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach"
18016,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her
18017,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
18018,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,How many days were you a slave?
18019,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Long enough to know
18020,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,Not long enough to understand
18021,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yezzan,I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen It's most impressive
18022,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune
18023,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Razdal,We came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
18024,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want"
18025,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Belicho,We want you to leave Slaver's Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
18026,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
18027,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Razdal,"When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them"
18028,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,"She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains"
18029,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Razdal,As they have since the dawn of time
18030,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,Not anymore
18031,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yezzan,You think you're a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master
18032,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"Friends, friends, friends, please"

18034,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yezzan,Slavery is the way of our world
18035,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order
18036,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yezzan,What does that mean?
18037,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
18038,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy"
18039,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yezzan,We do not support the Sons of the Harpy
18040,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer"
18041,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
18042,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before
18043,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time
18044,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,Perhaps I should translate for you
18045,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,We speak the Common Tongue
18046,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Excellent

18050,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
18051,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
18052,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
18053,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --
18054,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,When does she return?
18055,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Soon You have my word
18056,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,We don't know you We don't trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him
18057,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,"And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace"
18058,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,You have made peace with the slavers?
18059,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,We offered terms
18060,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,"And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?"
18061,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,"I am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it"
18062,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,"Missandei, you know what these men are How can you trust them?"
18063,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,I do not trust them I will never trust them
18064,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,"But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
18065,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,Do not use me for your lies
18066,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,Those men respect you
18067,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal
18068,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,As do I
18069,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,"I am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy"
18070,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
18071,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery
18072,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,For a short time
18073,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Missandei,Seven years is not a short time for a slave
18074,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today
18075,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,You are wrong to trust these men
18076,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
18077,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,You don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
18078,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tyrion Lannister,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
18079,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Grey Worm,You will not use them They will use you That is what they do
18080,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?
18081,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,I'm fine
18082,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,"I don't think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago, maybe"
18083,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,What?
18084,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,"Our queen She's wild, you know Don't let her size fool you It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man You, I don't think your heart could take it"
18085,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,Must make you angry that our queen chose me
18086,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on
18087,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,We'll all disappoint her before long
18088,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,We need each other right now After we're done needing each other --
18089,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,"Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain? If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man"
18090,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,"You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?"
18091,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,None
18092,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway"
18093,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,"Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen"
18094,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,What are you doing?
18095,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
18096,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
18097,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,"If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…"
18098,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth
18099,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,"There's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her"
18100,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,Uh…
18101,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,I'm very attached to this knife
18102,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,Don't worry it didn't touch you
18103,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,You know what happens?
18104,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,I know what happens
18105,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,I'll do it myself.
18106,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,I should have been born a Dothraki
18107,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,Come on
18108,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?
18109,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Dothraki,What do you sell?
18110,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,"Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest"
18111,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Dothraki,You're not merchants

18116,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,Huh
18117,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Leader,Some of them don't think Dothraki should breed with foreigners They are stupid old women They don't realize that we have always diluted our blood This one is Lhazareen Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village How old were you?
18118,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,Twelve
18119,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Leader,"A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter How did he show his happiness?"
18120,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,He broke my ribs
18121,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Leader,"We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom Our lives have meaning"

18125,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Leader,You can't run from Dothraki You know this

18128,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,I needed fresh air The old women stink
18129,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,They do stink
18130,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,You must have been very young when your Khal died
18131,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,Sixteen
18132,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,Too bad he didn't die sooner
18133,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,"Yes, too bad"
18134,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,Is it true you have three dragons?
18135,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,Mm-hmm
18136,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,And they breathe fire?
18137,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,They do Would you like to see them one day?
18138,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lhazareen Woman,"I am Dosh Khaleen I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die"

18140,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daario,She'll give us away
18141,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,We have to go now
18142,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive
18143,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jorah Mormont,All we can do is try
18144,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,No We can do more than that And you're going to help me
18145,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,"And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me"
18146,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,"If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?"
18147,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,"I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family"
18148,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,"Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair"
18149,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,Quality takes time
18150,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,"Yes I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better"
18151,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,"And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness Book of the Stranger, verse 25"
18152,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,You know
18153,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,Septa Unella reads it to me At me
18154,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,"Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was"
18155,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,So what did you do?
18156,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,I left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
18157,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,"Come, let's go and see him"
18158,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,Who?
18159,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sparrow,Your brother
18160,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,enters her brother's cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
18161,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,Loras. Loras.
18162,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
18163,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
18164,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Loras,I can't stay strong. I never was strong.
18165,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,"You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
18166,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Loras,I don't care about that.
18167,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?
18168,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Loras,I just want it to stop. Help me.
18169,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,"They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
18170,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Loras,Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
18171,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Loras,begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
18172,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Margaery Tyrell,All right.
18173,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
18174,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Maester Pycelle,"And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
18175,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,enters the room
18176,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,What are you doing here?
18177,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Maester Pycelle,I am advising the king on our current predicament.
18178,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,Leave.
18179,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Maester Pycell,I am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --
18180,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,Is this a Small Council meeting?
18181,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Maester Pycell,Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.
18182,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tommen Lannister,"Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
18183,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Maester Pycell,Your Grace.
18184,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Maester,"PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
18185,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,"Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
18186,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tommen Lannister,I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.
18187,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,"As have we all, unfortunately."
18188,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tommen Lannister,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.
18189,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
18190,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
18191,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tommen Lannister,"You don't like Margaery, do you?"
18192,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
18193,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tommen Lannister,Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
18194,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,You've spoken with him?
18195,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tommen Lannister,I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --
18196,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
18197,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Kevan,and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
18198,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
18199,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Kevin,and LADY OLENNA stand up.
18200,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lady Olenna,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.
18201,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
18202,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lady Olenna,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?"
18203,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jaime Lannister,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
18204,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
18205,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lady Olenna,"Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
18206,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,I agree.
18207,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jaime Lannister,"You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
18208,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Kevan,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.
18209,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jaime Lannister,"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
18210,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Kevan,"No, but if the king should call on me --"
18211,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jaime Lannister,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
18212,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
18213,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Kevan,Of course I want him back.
18214,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Cersei Lannister,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
18215,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Kevan,"If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die."
18216,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Lady Olenna,Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
18217,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
18218,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,"They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
18219,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,I escaped.
18220,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,I can't hear you.
18221,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
18222,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,I'm sorry.
18223,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,"You were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."
18224,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,I know. I know and I'm sorry.
18225,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,Stop saying that.
18226,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
18227,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,I know.
18228,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,You don't know.
18229,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,He send us one of those pieces. That's why I came for you.
18230,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,Why did you come here?
18231,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,Where else could I go?
18232,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?
18233,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,"No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
18234,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
18235,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,I didn't know.
18236,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?
18237,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,I don't want to be king.
18238,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,What do you want?
18239,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --
18240,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Yara Greyjoy,That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.
18241,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Theon Greyjoy,You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
18242,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
18243,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
18244,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,A lord?
18245,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,Yes. A lord. You've seen my banners?
18246,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,The flayed man.
18247,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,Does that worry you at all?
18248,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,You eat them after?
18249,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,No.
18250,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,Then I've seen worse.
18251,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife. RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
18252,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,You served the Starks?
18253,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,"Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them."
18254,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,"The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon."
18255,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,"He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed."
18256,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,"Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?"
18257,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,I can give you what you want.
18258,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,Are you sure you know what that is?
18259,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
18260,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,"Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first."
18261,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,You're a good talker.
18262,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,I like that.
18263,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
18264,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,That so?
18265,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
18266,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Ramsay Bolton,"He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it."
18267,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Osha,"gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece."
18268,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,"JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction."
18269,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Dolorous Edd,Sorry about the food. It's not what we're known for.
18270,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,That's all right. There are more important things.
18271,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Man,"A letter for you, Lord Commander."
18272,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
18273,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
18274,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."
18275,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,SNOW looks at SANSA.
18276,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
18277,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,Go on.
18278,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,It's just more of the same.
18279,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,"SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading."
18280,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."
18281,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
18282,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
18283,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,We don't know that.
18284,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,"Yes, we do."
18285,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tormund,How many men does he have in his army?
18286,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack."
18287,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,How many do you have?
18288,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Tormund,"That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people."
18289,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.
18290,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa Stark,A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
18291,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Jon Snow,SNOW nods.
18292,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
18293,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,So we don't spill blood.
18294,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,Well… there's always a little blood.
18295,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,Someone crushed his head with a rock.
18296,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.
18297,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,1 sits down.
18298,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,Bring in Drogo's widow.

18300,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,Who cares about her? She's a midget.
18301,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,I like her.
18302,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,She's paler than milk.
18303,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,I'd like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.
18304,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,Good. You can suck my dick.
18305,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
18306,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal,"The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They're offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?"
18307,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I'll take their horses for myself.
18308,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't you want to know what I think?
18309,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,You'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
18310,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,No. I don't want either of those things.
18311,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,"We don't care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are."
18312,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
18313,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,"And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo."
18314,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
18315,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,And you were dumb enough to believe him?
18316,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Daenerys Targaryen,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will."
18317,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we'll take turns fucking you. And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.
18318,2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,Khal Moro,"And If there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?"

The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows."
18322,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,Yes?
18323,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,"For you, my lady."
18324,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,How far is Mole's Town?
18325,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
18326,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,Unharmed? What are you doing here?
18327,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
18328,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy."
18329,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
18330,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,I can't begin to contemplate --
18331,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,What do you think he did to me?
18332,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Brienne,Lady Sansa asked you a question.
18333,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,He beat you.
18334,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?"
18335,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,"Sansa, I --"
18336,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,What else?
18337,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,Did he cut you?
18338,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
18339,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,I didn't know.
18340,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,I thought you knew everyone's secrets.
18341,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
18342,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
18343,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,I'm so sorry.
18344,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,You said you would protect me.
18345,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
18346,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?
18347,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
18348,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,What if I want you to die here and now?
18349,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,Then I will die.
18350,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
18351,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
18352,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,I have an army.
18353,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,Your brother's army.
18354,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Petyr Baelish,Half-brother.
18355,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Waif,You're not ready. You should go home before it's too late.
18356,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Waif,"You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark."
18357,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,She has a point.
18358,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
18359,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,Who was the first?
18360,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,"He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
18361,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,Where did they go?
18362,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,"Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."
18363,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,A girl has no desires.
18364,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,Who?
18365,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,"An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall."
18366,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,Ahh!
18367,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,"Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more."
18368,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Clarenzo,"Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don't die."
18369,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,"Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine."
18370,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Ladyc Rane,"I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?"
18371,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
18372,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,"Ooh! Ooh, what's happened here, then?"
18373,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,"He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you're the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand."
18374,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
18375,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,"I'd ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful."
18376,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,"I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go."
18377,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
18378,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,The Iron Throne's what I demand.
18379,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,You cannot.
18380,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,I can.
18381,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,You will not.
18382,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,I will.
18383,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,You dare not.
18384,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,I dare yes.
18385,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,The line of succession.
18386,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,What's that mean?
18387,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,The proper progression.
18388,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,The lawful ascension.
18389,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,"So move along, give me my chair and there won't be no more trouble."
18390,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,But we had a deal all done and dusted.
18391,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
18392,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bianca,Save my father.
18393,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
18394,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bianca,"Save him, please."
18395,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
18396,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Clarenzo,"Good people, you may all relax. My father's friend shall be spared the —"
18397,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bianca,"Father! No! Oh, father."
18398,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,"Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you'll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position's mine for life. And he's give me permission to take Sansa as my wife."
18399,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,You'll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
18400,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,"So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
18401,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Clarenzo,It's a wart. Two warts. I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
18402,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,"Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years."
18403,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Camello,"Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
18404,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,"You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
18405,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bianca,I had two lines.
18406,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Izembaro,There are no small parts. You rang very false.
18407,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bianca,I rang very false?
18408,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true."
18409,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bianca,You weren't complaining about me last night.
18410,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,"May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"
18411,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,"I'm a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we're going to be intimate."
18412,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,Of course we're going to be intimate.
18413,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,It's only a matter of time.
18414,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,To our children.
18415,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bobono,May they have your talent.
18416,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Lady Crane,And your filthy mind.
18417,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
18418,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
18419,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,A girl is not ready.
18420,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,She's a good actress.
18421,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,So a man has heard.
18422,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,Seems like a decent woman.
18423,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
18424,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,No. Who wants her dead?
18425,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,That does not matter. The price was paid.
18426,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
18427,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
18428,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Arya Stark,A girl has decided.
18429,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jaqen Hghar,A servant does not ask questions.
18430,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,No! No! No!
18431,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,It was you. You made the White Walkers.
18432,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Leaf,We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
18433,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,From whom?
18434,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Leaf,From you. From men.
18435,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aeron,We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
18436,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,"I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
18437,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,We've never had a queen. Not once.
18438,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,"There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
18439,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,All,Aye!
18440,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,We are a sea people.
18441,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,Our god is a sea god.
18442,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,"When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —"
18443,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,You shall not be queen!
18444,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,I am not finished!
18445,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,"Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon's own male heir has returned."
18446,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
18447,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,"And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
18448,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,She is a reaver!
18449,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,She is a warrior!
18450,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,She is ironborn!
18451,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
18452,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,I'm Euron Greyjoy.
18453,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,I claim the Salt Throne.
18454,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Niece.
18455,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Nephew. Little Theon.
18456,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
18457,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Explains why you think a woman can be king.
18458,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,"When did you return, Uncle?"
18459,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
18460,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
18461,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
18462,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,"That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
18463,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
18464,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
18465,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Theon Greyjoy,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
18466,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,And how will she do that?
18467,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
18468,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,"Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
18469,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Yara Greyjoy,You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
18470,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
18471,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aeron,"May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
18472,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aerson,Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
18473,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aeron,Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
18474,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aeron,"What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
18475,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aeron,What is dead may never die.
18476,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,All,What is dead may never die.
18477,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.
18478,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Aeron,They stole our best ships.
18479,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Won't be enough to save them.
18480,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Euron Greyjoy,Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
18481,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
18482,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jorah Mormont,You must send me away.
18483,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,Is there a cure?
18484,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jorah Mormont,I don't know.
18485,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,How long does it take?
18486,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jorah Mormont,I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
18487,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
18488,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jorah Mormont,"Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
18489,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,"Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
18490,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
18491,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
18492,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
18493,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Grey Worm,None.
18494,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
18495,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Grey Worm,"Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
18496,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
18497,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Grey Worm,For now.
18498,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,For now is the best we get in our profession.
18499,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,It's not enough.
18500,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
18501,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,"It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
18502,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Missandei,The people know who brought them freedom.
18503,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
18504,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
18505,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,Who said anything about “him”?
18506,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,"You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
18507,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,Welcome to Meereen.
18508,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
18509,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
18510,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
18511,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.
18512,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
18513,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,Yes.
18514,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
18515,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,She did indeed.
18516,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
18517,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
18518,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,"You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
18519,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,I'd settle for obeyed.
18520,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
18521,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,That sounds most excellent --
18522,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
18523,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
18524,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
18525,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
18526,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Varys,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
18527,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Tyrion Lannister,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
18528,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,"Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
18529,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
18530,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Kinvara,"We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
18531,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,What?
18532,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,"He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
18533,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,He touched you.
18534,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,"I don't know. He was close, but --"
18535,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,He knows you are here. He'll come for you.
18536,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,But he can't get in.
18537,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,"He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
18538,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
18539,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Hodor,Hodor.
18540,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
18541,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,The time has come.
18542,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,The time for what?
18543,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,For you to become me.
18544,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Bran Stark,But am I ready?
18545,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,No.
18546,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
18547,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
18548,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there."
18549,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
18550,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either."
18551,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
18552,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,"Precious little, my lady."
18553,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
18554,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
18555,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
18556,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."
18557,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
18558,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"No, but I do."
18559,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
18560,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
18561,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
18562,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,How do you know that?
18563,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
18564,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Davos,"That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
18565,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Brienne,"I've sworn to protect you, my lady."
18566,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
18567,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Brienne,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
18568,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
18569,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
18570,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,What is it?
18571,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Brienne,I don't like leaving you here alone.
18572,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,With Jon?
18573,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Brienne,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
18574,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
18575,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Brienne,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
18576,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,New dress?
18577,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,I made it myself. Do you like it?
18578,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
18579,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,"Good, because I made this for you."
18580,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
18581,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,"Thank you, Sansa."
18582,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Sansa Stark,You're welcome.
18583,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Jon Snow,Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
18584,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Dolorous Edd,I'll do my best.
18585,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Dolorous Edd,Good luck.
18586,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Man,"Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
18587,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Dolorous Edd,I'm not the Lord Comman --
18588,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Dolorous Edd,"Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate."
18589,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn't a cave."
18590,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Eat something that isn't moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
18591,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
18592,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Leaf,Get Bran and run!
18593,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran."
18594,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor.
18595,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran, wake up."
18596,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Hodor.
18597,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Help me!
18598,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Rickard,Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
18599,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Young Ned,"Yes, Father."
18600,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Rickard,"But if you have to fight, win."
18601,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran! Bran, wake up!"
18602,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up."
18603,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,You have to wake up. We need Hodor.
18604,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran, we're all going to die!"
18605,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran, wake up! We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!"
18606,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!"
18607,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Warg into Hodor now!
18608,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!"
18609,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,"Listen to your friend, Brandon."
18610,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Hodor,Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
18611,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Summer!
18612,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Leaf,Go. Go!
18613,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Threeeyed Raven,The time has come. Leave me.
18614,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,What are you doing?
18615,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Leaf,Go!
18616,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,"Hodor, hurry!"
18617,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Hold the door!
18618,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Meera,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
18620,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Young Hodor,Hold the door!
18621,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Young Hodor,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
18622,2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,Young Hodor,Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!
18623,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bran Stark,Meera. They found us.
18624,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Meera,I'm so sorry.
18625,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Rider,"Come with me, now."
18626,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Rider,The dead don't rest.
18627,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,It's so green.
18628,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
18629,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.
18630,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,That's not any better being a nervous mute.
18631,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
18632,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
18633,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,That Little Sam is your baby.
18634,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
18635,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,What did you tell your family about me?
18636,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,I told them I met you in the North.
18637,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,Did you tell them how far north?
18638,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
18639,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?
18640,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
18641,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,I think we're here.
18642,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"Sam. Oh, Sam."
18643,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, hello, Mother."
18644,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,I never thought I'd see you again. You look wonderful.
18645,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,Oh.
18646,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now."
18647,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Talla,Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
18648,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"That's enough, Talla."
18649,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
18650,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"Oh, my. You are lovely."
18651,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,"I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
18652,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
18653,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"Hello, little one. It's me, your grandmother."
18654,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,May I hold him?
18655,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,"Yes, of course."
18656,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"You have a curious mind, I can tell. You'll be a scholar like your father."
18657,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,Where is Father? And Dickon?
18658,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
18659,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Talla,"Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want."
18660,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,Is there no other way?
18661,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,You're afraid for her?
18662,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
18663,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.
18664,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
18665,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
18666,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
18667,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,"No, Your Grace."
18668,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,I've missed you. More than you could know.
18669,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
18670,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.
18671,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
18672,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,"Yes, a few times. Have you?"
18673,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,"Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
18674,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,You think I'm mad. I sound mad.
18675,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,"No. No, you don't. You- - you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more- -"
18676,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.
18677,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.
18678,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
18679,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
18680,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,I don't understand.
18681,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
18682,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,What about Loras?
18683,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Margaery Tyrell,"I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
18684,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,It's hard to walk in this.
18685,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,It's beautiful. You're beautiful.
18686,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
18687,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Dickon,"Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's."
18688,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
18689,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Dickon,Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
18690,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, that's a fair distance."
18691,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Dickon,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
18692,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
18693,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Dickon,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
18694,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
18695,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
18696,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Talla,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
18697,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,That's enough of that.
18698,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
18699,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
18700,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,Not fat enough already?
18701,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
18702,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,I read your letter. You're to be a maester.
18703,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
18704,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
18705,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.
18706,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor."
18707,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
18708,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Dickon,There's no such thing.
18709,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
18710,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?
18711,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,The Night's Watch came to our keep.
18712,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,Where?
18713,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,Gilly.
18714,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,North of the Wall.
18715,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
18716,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,"It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home."
18717,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,"Come, my dear. Talla."
18718,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,I've lost my appetite.
18719,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,He dishonors us.
18720,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Melessa,You dishonor yourself.
18721,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Randyll,"Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
18722,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
18723,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,I'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
18724,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,First light.
18725,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,Say good-bye to him for me.
18726,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,"You're not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn't know what you are."
18727,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Good-bye, Gilly."
18728,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,Sam?
18729,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,We're leaving.
18730,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,What?
18731,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,Get your things.
18732,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,I don't have any things.
18733,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,What are you doing?
18734,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,We belong together. All of us.
18735,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,What about your mother and sister?
18736,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,"Oh, they'll understand."
18737,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,Your sister's dress.
18738,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.
18739,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,Sam. That's your father's sword.
18740,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,It's my family's sword.
18741,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Gilly,Sam. Won't he come for it?
18742,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sam,He can bloody well try.
18743,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Clarenzo,The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
18744,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Clarenzo,"And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."
18745,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,All,Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
18746,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Clarenzo,"I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?"
18747,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,"Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine."
18748,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
18749,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Clarenzo,Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
18750,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Clarenzo,I limp. And it was he…
18751,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Clarenzo,that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
18752,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain."
18753,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief."
18754,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow."
18755,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,What is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.
18756,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
18757,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.
18758,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,No worse child ever stained this land.
18759,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,Curse the day I named you.
18760,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
18761,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
18762,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,Don't fear the winter.
18763,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bobono,Fear me!
18764,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo."
18765,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,I give you Bobono.
18766,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,I give you Camello.
18767,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,"And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane."
18768,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Camello,Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.
18769,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,That crowd was shit.
18770,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,Girl.
18771,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,What are you doing back here?
18772,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,Nothing.
18773,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
18774,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,Three times.
18775,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,Did you pay?
18776,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,No.
18777,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"I remember when the players came to my village. I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
18778,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,You're very good.
18779,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,My final speech is shit.
18780,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good."
18781,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
18782,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,How would you change it?
18783,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
18784,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,What's your name?
18785,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,Mercy.
18786,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"You have very expressive eyes, Mercy."
18787,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
18788,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,I have to go. My father's waiting for me.
18789,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bianca,"Lady Crane, they loved you."
18790,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
18791,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,No laugh for Nedo s death. These people are worse than animals.
18792,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,But they loved her. They all love her.
18793,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Camello,"Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
18794,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,I do what I can with what I'm given.
18795,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,With what you're given?
18796,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,"Well, I was thinking- -"
18797,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,"Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?"
18798,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,Full to the tits with ideas.
18799,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lady Crane,I didn't mean- -
18800,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,"You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing."
18801,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Izembaro,You have no right to an opinion.
18802,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Arya Stark,Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
18803,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaqen Hghar,And?
18804,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Waif,As I expected.
18805,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaqen Hghar,A shame. A girl had many gifts.
18806,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Waif,You promised me.
18807,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaqen Hghar,Don't let her suffer.
18808,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Mace,My lord.
18809,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,My lord.
18810,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Mace,"My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!"
18811,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Captain,"Forward, march!"
18812,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,"Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself."
18813,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Captain,"Company, halt! Face front! Turn!"
18814,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,Lord Tyrell.
18815,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,Ser Jaime.
18816,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
18817,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,I don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them.
18818,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Captain,Lock spears!
18819,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
18820,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
18821,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
18822,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
18823,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Captain,Order up!
18824,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
18825,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Sparrow,Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
18826,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Woman,"Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!"
18827,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
18828,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Mace,What's happening?
18829,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Olenna Tyrell,He's beaten us. That's what's happening.
18830,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,"When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
18831,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
18832,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,I have to answer to the gods.
18833,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,Not when you're sitting in that chair.
18834,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,The Crown's decision on this matter is final.
18835,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
18836,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Tommen Lannister,You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
18837,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,You've lost it?
18838,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Black Walder,"Yes, father."
18839,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
18840,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lothar,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
18841,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun."
18842,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Black Walder,I don't think it's fair to blame us- -
18843,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
18844,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Black Walder,We don't have the men.
18845,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
18846,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Black Walder,The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
18847,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lothar,"The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
18848,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Black Walder,Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
18849,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us."
18850,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
18851,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Lothar,"He'll never yield, Father."
18852,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"Oh, he'll yield."
18853,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew."
18854,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Walder,"Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home."
18855,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
18856,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
18857,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,I'm not going to the Riverlands.
18858,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,"What, then?"
18859,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
18860,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,You can't.
18861,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
18862,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
18863,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Jaime Lannister,You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
18864,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them."
18865,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.
18866,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Cersei Lannister,We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.
18867,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Meera,Why did you help us?
18868,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Rider,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
18869,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Meera,The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.
18870,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Rider,Now he lives again.
18871,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Rider,"When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
18872,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bran Stark,Who are you?
18873,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bran Stark,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
18874,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Benjen,I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
18875,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bran Stark,How?
18876,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Benjen,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
18877,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bran Stark,Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
18878,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Benjen,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
18879,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Bran Stark,I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.
18880,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Benjen,You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
18881,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Benjen,Drink.
18882,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Benjen,"One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready."
18883,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,Everything all right?
18884,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,How many days' ride to Meereen?
18885,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,A week at best.
18886,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
18887,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,"Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
18888,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,And who has that many?
18889,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,Nobody.
18890,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Nobody yet.
18891,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
18892,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,I take what is mine.
18893,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance.
18894,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,What was I made for?
18895,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,"You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
18896,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Wait here.
18897,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daario,I'm going after her. Wait for me here.
18898,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
18899,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
18900,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
18901,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
18902,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Are you with me?
18903,2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,Daenerys Targaryen,Now and always?
18904,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,That's it. Get it to the top.
18905,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,Steady. Steady.
18906,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,Up she goes.
18907,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
18908,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Here you are, son."
18909,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Oh, gentlemen, please."
18910,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on."
18911,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
18912,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,Just one.
18913,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
18914,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,He was a woman.
18915,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
18916,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,I'm used to it.
18917,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
18918,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?"
18919,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,Hate.
18920,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"No, there's a reason you're still here."
18921,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,"Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill."
18922,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"No, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet."
18923,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,"I've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
18924,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Well, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods."
18925,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,You're in the wrong line of work.
18926,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane."
18927,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,You didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.
18928,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,I've heard stories.
18929,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,If the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?
18930,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,They have.
18931,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,Your Grace. What are we reading today?
18932,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
18933,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
18934,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
18935,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom."
18936,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
18937,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,They are hard to love.
18938,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume."
18939,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
18940,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,Of course.
18941,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed."
18942,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,No.
18943,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
18944,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,It's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
18945,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
18946,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
18947,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
18948,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,My grandmother?
18949,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sparrow,"Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
18950,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
18951,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
18952,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"Oh, this is madness!"
18953,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
18954,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,Grandmother.
18955,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
18956,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"Grandmother, please."
18957,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,What have they done to you?
18958,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
18959,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,We marched for you.
18960,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy."
18961,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
18962,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title..."
18963,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,Have you lost your mind?
18964,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,and live his life as a penitent.
18965,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
18966,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,He can begin again.
18967,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,As a mindless fanatic.
18968,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,As a free man.
18969,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
18970,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
18971,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
18972,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,I will never leave you. Never.
18973,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,You must.
18974,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
18975,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,The Mother watches over us all.
18976,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"I'll see you soon, my dear."
18977,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,"Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
18978,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Margaery Tyrell,Shall we pray?
18979,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Dim Dalba,"We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find."
18980,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Tormund,"If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
18981,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Dim Dalba,"Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk."
18982,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,"That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
18983,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Tormund,"The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
18984,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Wun Wun,Snow.
18985,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,Are you sure they'll come?
18986,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Tormund,"We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it."
18987,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Cersei Lannister,I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
18988,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,That is hardly your concern.
18989,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Cersei Lannister,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
18990,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
18991,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Cersei Lannister,You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
18992,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,Good.
18993,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Cersei Lannister,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
18994,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
18995,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Cersei Lannister,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
18996,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
18997,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Cersei Lannister,Never. I'll never leave my son.
18998,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Olenna Tyrell,"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
18999,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,Pick the pace up. Keep going.
19000,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,Keep it moving!
19001,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
19002,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,Someone certainly does.
19003,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,"Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
19004,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
19005,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,"Aye, knights don't get paid."
19006,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
19007,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
19008,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
19009,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
19010,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
19011,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
19012,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lothar,"Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him."
19013,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lothar,This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
19014,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Black Walder,"You think I won't do it, old man?"
19015,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Black Walder,I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
19016,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,"Go on, then. Cut his throat."
19017,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"Lothar, is it?"
19018,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lothar,Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.
19019,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
19020,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
19021,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
19022,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Black Walder,"Whoa, whoa."
19023,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lothar,Walder.
19024,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Black Walder,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
19025,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
19026,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Black Walder,I don't give a rat's- -
19027,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.
19028,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lothar,"Apologies, Ser Jaime."
19029,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lothar,Do as he says.
19030,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
19031,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
19032,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Black Walder,Those are our siege towers- -
19033,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
19034,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
19035,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,A parley or a fight?
19036,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,He's an old man.
19037,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Bronn,You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
19038,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,Lady Mormont.
19039,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,Welcome to Bear Island.
19040,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
19041,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
19042,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
19043,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?
19044,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
19045,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
19046,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
19047,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports."
19048,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
19049,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
19050,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
19051,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
19052,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
19053,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"I don't know you, Ser…?"
19054,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
19055,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
19056,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
19057,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
19058,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"Go on, Ser Davos."
19059,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
19060,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,Is this true?
19061,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
19062,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
19063,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
19064,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
19065,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,62.
19066,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,62?
19067,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lyanna,"We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
19068,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
19069,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,Kingslayer.
19070,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,Blackfish.
19071,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.
19072,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,I don't have them.
19073,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
19074,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,Then why are you here?
19075,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
19076,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,Or you'll kill Edmure?
19077,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
19078,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
19079,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
19080,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
19081,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
19082,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
19083,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,"As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
19084,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
19085,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,"Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
19086,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jaime Lannister,"Well, now you have."
19087,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Brynden,"Aye, now I have. I'm disappointed."
19088,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,The answer is no.
19089,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
19090,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
19091,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
19092,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
19093,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,House Mormont.
19094,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,And?
19095,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
19096,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
19097,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
19098,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
19099,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,Lord Glover.
19100,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,There's nothing else to say.
19101,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
19102,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North."
19103,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
19104,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Robett,"I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."
19105,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,Why did we have to come here?
19106,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
19107,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,I don't want one.
19108,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"Don't go far, love."
19109,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,I'll find you in a bit.
19110,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?
19111,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?"
19112,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
19113,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat."
19114,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,He'll find us.
19115,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,It's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
19116,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,I don't want any.
19117,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,I don't care what you want. Drink.
19118,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,Drink it all.
19119,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"You're Ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years."
19120,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,Some bad years?
19121,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
19122,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink."
19123,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you."
19124,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Theon Greyjoy,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
19125,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink."
19126,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands."
19127,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,Are you with me? Are you really with me?
19128,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Yara Greyjoy,"Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one."
19129,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
19130,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,And that's a good thing?
19131,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
19132,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
19133,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
19134,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
19135,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
19136,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,62 Mormonts.
19137,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
19138,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,For fuck's sake.
19139,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
19140,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
19141,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
19142,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,It's not enough. We need more men.
19143,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,There's no time.
19144,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sansa Stark,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
19145,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Jon Snow,We fight with the army we have.
19146,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"
19147,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,"This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting."
19148,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,Who the fuck are you?
19149,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Davos,Hold on.
19150,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,"Yeah, who the fuck are you?"
19151,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
19152,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep."
19153,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name. I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
19154,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
19155,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,It's never too late to come back.
19156,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
19157,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?"
19158,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lem,What are you doing here?
19159,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Well, we're talking about life. You?"
19160,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lem,Protecting the people.
19161,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
19162,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lem,Do you have any horses?
19163,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,No horses. No gold. No steel.
19164,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lem,"Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
19165,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"I'm sure it is. You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
19166,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Lem,Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
19167,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,"Seven save you, friends.”"
19168,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
19169,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,They don't believe in your Seven. They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
19170,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them."
19171,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,"Sure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't. And you've got women."
19172,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
19173,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,"It'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight."
19174,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,You do.
19175,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,I'm done with fighting.
19176,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,Even if it's to protect yourself?
19177,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
19178,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,"You don't cure it by dying, either."
19179,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
19180,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Sandor,It's gonna be a cold night. We'll need firewood.
19181,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Ray,I'll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
19182,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,He's not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay. I'm inclined to believe him. I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
19183,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Arya Stark,You're Westerosi.
19184,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,What do you care?
19185,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Arya Stark,I want to book passage home.
19186,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,You? Can't afford it.
19187,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,Where'd you steal this from?
19188,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Arya Stark,Why do you care?
19189,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Man,We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
19190,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Arya Stark,I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.
19191,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Arya Stark,See you at sunrise.
19192,2016-06-05,Season 6,Episode 7,The Broken Man,Woman,Sweet girl.
19193,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,"My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life."
19194,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,You're good at that. Where did you learn?
19195,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.
19196,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,"So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up."
19197,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,And good at putting holes in them.
19198,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,And that.
19199,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
19200,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,Bianca.
19201,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
19202,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,Mmm.
19203,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
19204,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,I can't.
19205,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,"Why not? Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress."
19206,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
19207,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,Come with us. What's left for you here?
19208,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
19209,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,Who?
19210,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,She doesn't have a name.
19211,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,Where will you go?
19212,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
19213,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,I don't know.
19214,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.
19215,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,"The edge of the world, maybe."
19216,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,I'd like to see that.
19217,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,What's that?
19218,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,Milk of the poppy.
19219,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,I don't want any.
19220,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lady Crane,"Sleep is the only way you'll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will."
19221,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Man,"Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
19222,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
19223,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Young Man,Course we do.
19224,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,"This is for masters, this technique. You're not ready."
19225,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Young Man,I'm ready.
19226,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Man,He says he's ready.
19227,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,All right.
19228,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,"Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head."
19229,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.
19230,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,"Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole."
19231,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Man,So fucking close!
19232,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,"Ah, it smells like pussy to me."
19233,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Man,"Look at him. You get hard, boy?"
19234,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Young Man,Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
19235,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Young Man,"Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?"
19236,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Where's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
19237,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,Fuck you!
19238,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,"Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better."
19239,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Gatins,Cunt!
19240,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,"You're shit at dying, you know that?"
19241,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Red Priestess,"From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."
19242,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,I'd call that a successful gambit.
19243,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,Would you?
19244,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Look around. The city has come back to life.
19245,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,You made a pact with fanatics.
19246,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,I did and it worked.
19247,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
19248,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
19249,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,I'm going to miss you.
19250,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,I know.
19251,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
19252,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
19253,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
19254,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"Most of all, we need our queen."
19255,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
19256,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Varys,I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
19257,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Varys.
19258,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,The most famous dwarf in the world.
19259,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Qyburn,"Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
19260,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
19261,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Qyburn,"They demand to see you, Your Grace."
19262,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
19263,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,The king is aware of their presence?
19264,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Qyburn,"He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer."
19265,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lancel,"Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
19266,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
19267,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lancel,"Your Grace, this is not a request."
19268,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
19269,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lancel,The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
19270,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
19271,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lancel,He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
19272,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,Get out.
19273,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lancel,"Move aside, ser."
19274,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lancel,Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
19275,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,I choose violence.
19276,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
19277,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,"Looks like a siege, my lady."
19278,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"You have a keen military mind, Pod."
19279,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,My lady. My lady.
19280,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Man,Who goes there? State your business!
19281,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
19282,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
19283,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
19284,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,Not yet.
19285,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,Are they in there?
19286,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,Mm-hmm.
19287,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,You think they're fucking?
19288,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,What? No.
19289,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
19290,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,I'm her squire.
19291,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
19292,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,You must have shown it to her by now.
19293,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,She's training me to fight.
19294,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,Is she? Oh.
19295,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,"An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
19296,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
19297,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,"Well, that's a different sort of fighting."
19298,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
19299,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"All right, let's start with your footwork."
19300,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,Show me your stance.
19301,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
19302,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bronn,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
19303,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
19304,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Why would you assume that?
19305,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
19306,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,I don't think you know many girls like her.
19307,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
19308,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
19309,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,I've come for the Blackfish.
19310,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,You're welcome to have him.
19311,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
19312,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
19313,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,The Tully army.
19314,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
19315,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
19316,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
19317,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
19318,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Exactly.
19319,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,We shouldn't argue about politics.
19320,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
19321,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
19322,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
19323,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,What do you propose?
19324,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
19325,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
19326,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
19327,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
19328,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,No.
19329,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,He's even more stubborn than you are.
19330,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
19331,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
19332,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,You have my word. You have until nightfall.
19333,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
19334,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,It's yours. It will always be yours.
19335,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"one last thing, Ser Jaime."
19336,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
19337,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
19338,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Of course it does.
19339,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,To fight you.
19340,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
19341,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,I've said no three times already.
19342,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
19343,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.
19344,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,Double the guards tonight.
19345,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Bryndel,The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
19346,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"As I have said, my name is- -"
19347,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,"Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
19348,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,He always spoke highly of you.
19349,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,"And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you."
19350,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,"If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool."
19351,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
19352,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
19353,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,He's not my friend.
19354,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,No?
19355,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
19356,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
19357,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,She's exactly like her mother.
19358,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
19359,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,You have more than she does.
19360,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,"She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
19361,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
19362,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Podrick,What should I write?
19363,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Tell her I failed.
19364,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,There's to be a royal announcement?
19365,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Kevan,There is.
19366,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,Why wasn't I informed?
19367,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Kevan,There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
19368,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Kevan,Where are you going?
19369,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,To stand by my son.
19370,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Kevan,Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
19371,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tommen Lannister,"Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
19372,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tommen Lannister,"Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
19373,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Crowd,Seven blessings.
19374,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Qyburn,Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
19375,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Cersei Lannister,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
19376,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Qyburn,More. Much more.
19377,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,You seem happy.
19378,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
19379,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Now it's like a man reborn.
19380,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,I will be happy when our queen returns.
19381,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
19382,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,Unsullied never drink.
19383,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Why not?
19384,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,Rules.
19385,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,And who made these rules? Your former masters?
19386,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
19387,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,And you? What's your excuse?
19388,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
19389,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,That's how you know it's working.
19390,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
19391,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
19392,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,Long may she reign.
19393,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Do you like it?
19394,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,Tastes like it has turned.
19395,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
19396,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
19397,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,I do not know any jokes.
19398,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Grey worm?
19399,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
19400,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
19401,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,It's funnier in Westeros.
19402,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,"The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
19403,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Yes.
19404,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,"A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
19405,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
19406,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
19407,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,I do.
19408,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Tell a joke.
19409,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,Two translators are on a sinking ship.
19410,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,"The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”"
19411,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,Ah!
19412,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,That is the worst joke I ever heard.
19413,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,You don't even know what a joke is.
19414,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
19415,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,You lied to us.
19416,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,I make joke.
19417,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,More jokes.
19418,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
19419,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,The Masters have come for their property.
19420,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Lord Edmure.
19421,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
19422,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,I have your word?
19423,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,"Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing."
19424,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
19425,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.
19426,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
19427,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
19428,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
19429,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.
19430,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
19431,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.
19432,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
19433,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,"Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?"
19434,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,"Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?"
19435,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
19436,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Yeah. She should have killed you.
19437,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
19438,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?
19439,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
19440,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,"Oh. Oh, I see. You're a madman."
19441,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
19442,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Don't talk about Cat!
19443,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,I'll talk about whomever I want.
19444,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
19445,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,They'd do anything to protect their babies.
19446,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
19447,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
19448,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
19449,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
19450,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,Who goes there?
19451,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,"Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
19452,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,Don't let him in.
19453,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,He's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
19454,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,"He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it's a trap, you idiot. Don't let him in."
19455,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,"He's my lord, my lord. I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
19456,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,You're not obeying Edmure's commands. You're obeying the fucking Kinglsayer's commands.
19457,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,I demand entry.
19458,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,My lord has given an order.
19459,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
19460,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -
19461,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
19462,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,"You are not lord of this castle, my lord."
19463,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,Lower the drawbridge!
19464,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard,"Aye, ser!"
19465,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Black Walder,"If you're wrong, we're just surrendered our most valuable prisoner."
19466,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,"Welcome home, my lord."
19467,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
19468,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,My lord- -
19469,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Your lord has given a command.
19470,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Edmure,Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
19471,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard Captain,Find him.
19472,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,Go on.
19473,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Come with us.
19474,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,I've run before from the Red Wedding. I'm not running again. This is my family home.
19475,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brienne,Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
19476,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
19477,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,"Go on, now."
19478,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Brynden,I haven't had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.
19479,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard,"We found the Blackfish, my lord."
19480,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaime Lannister,Good. Bring him to me.
19481,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Guard,"He died fighting, my lord."
19482,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,I was wrong. I admit it.
19483,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Missandei,That changes nothing.
19484,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
19485,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
19486,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
19487,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
19488,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,"All right, what should the army do?"
19489,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,"We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
19490,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Tyrion Lannister,And then?
19491,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Grey Worm,We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
19492,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,Clegane.
19493,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,What the fuck you doing here?
19494,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Chasing them. You?
19495,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,Hanging them.
19496,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Any particular reason?
19497,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
19498,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
19499,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,You've got friends?
19500,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Not anymore. They're mine.
19501,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,It's the Brotherhoodo s good name they've dragged through the dirt.
19502,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,"Fuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
19503,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,"Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
19504,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
19505,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,You can have one of them.
19506,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Two.
19507,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,"No, no, no."
19508,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,We're not butchers. We hang them.
19509,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,hanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?
19510,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,They die.
19511,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,We all bloody die.
19512,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Except this one here. I'll only gut one of them.
19513,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,No.
19514,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,I'll chop off one hand.
19515,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.
19516,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Bunch of nancies.
19517,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
19518,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,"You're getting old, Clegane."
19519,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,He's not.
19520,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Lem,Please don't. I'll give you anything.
19521,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Got anything to eat?
19522,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,Enjoying yourself?
19523,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,I prefer chicken.
19524,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,You ought to join us. We could use you.
19525,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.
19526,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Thoros,"Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
19527,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
19528,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,Cold winds are rising in the North.
19529,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,And you're going to go stop them?
19530,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,We need good men to help us.
19531,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,"Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
19532,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
19533,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Sandor,"I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now."
19534,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Beric,"Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you."
19535,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,Lady Crane?
19536,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Waif,"If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
19537,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Waif,Instead…
19538,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Waif,The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can't change that. I can't change that. No one can. And now he's been promised another name.
19539,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Waif,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
19540,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Waif,Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.
19541,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,You told her to kill me.
19542,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaqen Hghar,Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
19543,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Jaqen Hghar,Finally a girl is no one.
19544,2016-06-12,Season 6,Episode 8,No One,Arya Stark,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
19545,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
19546,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,Perhaps we should take shelter.
19547,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,The city is on the rise?
19548,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
19549,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
19550,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,it proves that no one needs a Master.
19551,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,Good. Shall we begin?
19552,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,Do we have a plan?
19553,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
19554,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,You don't approve?
19555,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
19556,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
19557,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,This is entirely different.
19558,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
19559,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Razdal,"Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
19560,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
19561,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yezzan,The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
19562,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,"We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
19563,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Razdal,I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
19564,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,My reign has just begun.
19565,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys.
19566,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Grey Worm,You men have a choice
19567,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Grey Worm,"fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
19568,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
19569,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Missandei,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
19570,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
19571,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Razdal,Him. He should die.
19572,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Belicho,"Yes, him."
19573,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Razdal,"He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
19574,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yezzan,Please.
19575,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
19576,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,You don't have to be here.
19577,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"Yes, I do."
19578,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,My beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.
19579,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy."
19580,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
19581,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
19582,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
19583,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?"
19584,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,How do we know you have him?
19585,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"Now, if you want to save —"
19586,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
19587,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
19588,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
19589,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
19590,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
19591,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
19592,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
19593,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
19594,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,stares blankly at JON SNOW.
19595,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,A pincer move.
19596,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
19597,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Good.
19598,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
19599,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
19600,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
19601,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,We should all get some sleep.
19602,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,"Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
19603,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
19604,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"Aye, for what they're worth."
19605,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
19606,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,You're right.
19607,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
19608,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,He's overconfident.
19609,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
19610,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
19611,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,You don't know him.
19612,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
19613,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
19614,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,We can't give up on our brother.
19615,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
19616,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
19617,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
19618,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"Aye, that's good advice."
19619,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,You think that's obvious?
19620,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
19621,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
19622,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
19623,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,It's not enough!
19624,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
19625,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
19626,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
19627,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
19628,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,You think there's hope?
19629,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,"I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?"
19630,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
19631,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,You saw these demons?
19632,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,What?
19633,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
19634,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,"Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
19635,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
19636,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Jon Snow's not a king.
19637,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"No, he's not."
19638,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
19639,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
19640,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,So what do you do all night?
19641,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
19642,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Happy shitting.
19643,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,My lady. You weren't at the war council.
19644,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,I'm not a soldier.
19645,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,Any advice?
19646,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,Don't lose.
19647,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
19648,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,I'll have to try.
19649,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
19650,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
19651,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
19652,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
19653,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,How do you know what he commands?
19654,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
19655,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,Why?
19656,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
19657,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,What kind of god would do something like that?
19658,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Melisandre,The one we've got.
19659,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
19660,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,It was a long time ago.
19661,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
19662,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
19663,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,And he paid for them.
19664,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
19665,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,"You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
19666,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,Not my claim. Hers.
19667,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,And what's wrong with you?
19668,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,I'm not fit to rule.
19669,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,We can agree upon that at least.
19670,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
19671,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,No more than Westeros.
19672,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
19673,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
19674,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,You and I have that in common.
19675,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
19676,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,Will their ships be enough?
19677,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
19678,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.
19679,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,So why shouldn't I wait for him?
19680,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
19681,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,"His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other."
19682,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
19683,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,"I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really."
19684,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
19685,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,The Seven Kingdoms.
19686,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,All of them.
19687,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
19688,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Theon Greyjoy,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
19689,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,And that's all?
19690,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
19691,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,Reasonable.
19692,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tyrion Lannister,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
19693,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
19694,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
19695,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,That's our way of life.
19696,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Daenerys Targaryen,No more.
19697,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Yara Greyjoy,No more.
19698,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"Do you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
19699,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
19700,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Don't.
19701,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
19702,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
19703,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Run and fight!
19704,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,Now.
19705,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Karstark,"Cavalry, charge!"
19706,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.
19707,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,Loose!
19708,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,Get word --
19709,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,We may as well be taking shits back here.
19710,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,Follow!
19711,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"It's time, go."
19712,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Smalljon,Who owns the North?
19713,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,All,We do!
19714,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Smalljon,Show me!
19715,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,Hey!
19716,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Man,"Infantry, advance!"
19717,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Davos,"With me, lads! Break their line!"
19718,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Man,Tormund!
19719,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Man,Get him back!
19720,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Tormund,"Fuck this, come on!"
19721,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,Their army's gone.
19722,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Man,Our army's gone.
19723,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,We have Winterfell. They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
19724,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"You suggested one on one combat, didn't you?"
19725,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
19726,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Jon Snow,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
19727,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,Jon.
19728,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,Where is he?
19729,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now."
19730,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
19731,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,My hounds will never harm me.
19732,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
19733,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,They're loyal beasts.
19734,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Sansa Stark,They were. Now they're starving.
19735,2016-06-19,Season 6,Episode 9,Battle of the Bastards,Ramsay Bolton,Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
19736,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Attendant,Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.
19737,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Mistress,You got my money?
19738,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Pycelle,Later. Go away.
19739,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Girl,Grand Maester.
19740,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
19741,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Loras,There'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
19742,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,To which crimes will you be confessing?
19743,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Loras,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
19744,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Loras,"I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
19745,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,"The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her."
19746,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Loras,I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
19747,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,You understand fully what this means?
19748,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Loras,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
19749,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,Brother Loras…
19750,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
19751,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
19752,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Loras,I will.
19753,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Mace,"No, I can't let them…"
19754,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,"Faith is the way, Father."
19755,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tommen Lannister,All right. I'm ready.
19756,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tommen Lannister,"I have to go, I'm-- I'm late for the trial."
19757,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
19758,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,"I've kept my word. Once the queen mother's trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave."
19759,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,And where is the queen mother?
19760,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lancel,Her litter never left the Red Keep.
19761,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.
19762,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
19763,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lancel,Get the others.
19764,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Pycelle,Where's the king?
19765,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,"Elsewhere, I'm afraid."
19766,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Pycelle,What's the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--
19767,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,"Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can."
19768,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,"This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest."
19769,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lancel,"The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you."
19770,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lancel,What are you doing?
19771,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,There's something wrong.
19772,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,"You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly."
19773,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
19774,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sparrow,"If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--"
19775,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,"Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave."
19776,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,We all need to leave now!
19777,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,Loras. Stay with me.
19778,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
19779,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Margaery Tyrell,Let us through!
19780,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,Confess. Confess.
19781,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Septa Unella,No.
19782,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,Confess.
19783,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
19784,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,You've always been quiet.
19785,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
19786,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Septa Unella,Good. I'm glad to see your face. I'm ready to meet the gods.
19787,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
19788,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
19789,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
19790,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,Shame.
19791,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Attendant,"I'm very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry."
19792,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,For House Lannister!
19793,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Men,Hear me roar!
19794,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,For House Frey!
19795,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Men,We stand together!
19796,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last."
19797,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”"
19798,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?"
19799,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
19800,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,You're welcome to her.
19801,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
19802,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,Those two have their eyes on you.
19803,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
19804,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,Not my type.
19805,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,Not blonde enough?
19806,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
19807,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,There you go.
19808,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,Maybe I'm not in the mood.
19809,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,Fuck it.
19810,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bronn,No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
19811,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
19812,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,I'm sure he would be.
19813,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,Edmure is back in a cell. Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right. Give the family a bad name.
19814,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
19815,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
19816,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,I'm a bit old for all that.
19817,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,"No, but back in your day."
19818,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?"
19819,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.
19820,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
19821,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
19822,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
19823,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,Show me.
19824,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,"Your Grace, there's no need--"
19825,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,"What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
19826,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei Lannister,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
19827,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sam,Hello.
19828,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sam,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
19829,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sam,I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.
19830,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Maester,Oh.
19831,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Maester,"According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
19832,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sam,He died.
19833,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Maester,We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
19834,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sam,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.
19835,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Maester,This is irregular.
19836,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sam,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
19837,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Maester,"The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me."
19838,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Maester,No women or children!
19839,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
19840,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,"Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
19841,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
19842,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,What is that?
19843,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
19844,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,The Princess Shireen.
19845,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
19846,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,We burned her at the stake.
19847,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,Why?
19848,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
19849,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,You burned a little girl alive!
19850,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,I only do what my Lord commands!
19851,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
19852,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
19853,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
19854,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
19855,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
19856,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,I didn't lie. I was wrong.
19857,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
19858,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
19859,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
19860,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Melisandre,"I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
19861,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
19862,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Davos,"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
19863,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
19864,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,Mother and Father's room? You should take it.
19865,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,I'm not a Stark.
19866,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,You are to me.
19867,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
19868,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,He did.
19869,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,And you trust him?
19870,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
19871,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
19872,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,Jon.
19873,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
19874,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
19875,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
19876,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Ellaria,"You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
19877,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
19878,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Obara,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
19879,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,What is your name again? Barbaro?
19880,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Obara,Obara.
19881,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.
19882,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Nymeria,"Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
19883,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,"Do shut up, dear."
19884,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,Anything from you?
19885,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
19886,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Ellaria,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
19887,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
19888,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Ellaria,You're absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart's desire.
19889,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell,And what is my heart's desire?
19890,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Ellaria,Vengeance. Justice.
19891,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Varys,Fire and blood.
19892,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
19893,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
19894,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,You're not coming with us.
19895,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,"New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing."
19896,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
19897,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,"Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I'm here for you, not them."
19898,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
19899,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,Who are you marrying this time?
19900,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,I don't know. Maybe no one.
19901,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
19902,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
19903,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,A king wouldn't think twice about it.
19904,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
19905,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.
19906,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
19907,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,I can't.
19908,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,The dwarf told you to do this.
19909,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,No one tells me to do anything.
19910,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.
19911,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't get angry.
19912,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,"I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
19913,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
19914,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,Bay of Dragons?
19915,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
19916,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,"You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
19917,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daario,I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what's coming for them.
19918,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"Farewell, Daario Naharis."
19919,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,How did he take it?
19920,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,No tears.
19921,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
19922,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,It's not.
19923,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,"No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."
19924,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, you really are."
19925,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
19926,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
19927,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
19928,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
19929,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
19930,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
19931,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,"I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."
19932,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,It's your counsel I need.
19933,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tyrion Lannister,It's yours. Now and always.
19934,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right."
19935,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Daenerys Targaryen,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
19936,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"You're not one of mine, are you?"
19937,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Handmaiden,"No, my lord."
19938,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,Didn't think so. Too pretty.
19939,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
19940,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Handmaiden,"They're here, my lord."
19941,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
19942,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Handmaiden,"But they're already here, my lord."
19943,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Handmaiden,"Here, my lord."
19944,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Handmaiden,They weren't easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
19945,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Walder,What…
19946,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Arya Stark,My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
19947,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Petyr,"Forgive me, my lady… if you're at prayer."
19948,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,"I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
19949,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,I was a stupid girl.
19950,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Petyr,You were a child.
19951,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,What do you want?
19952,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Petyr,I thought you knew what I wanted.
19953,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,I was wrong.
19954,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Petyr,"No, you weren't. Every time I'm faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
19955,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,It's a pretty picture.
19956,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Petyr,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.
19957,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Sansa Stark,"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself."
19958,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Petyr,"The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
19959,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Benjen,This is where I leave you.
19960,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Meera,You're not coming with us?
19961,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Benjen,"The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
19962,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Meera,Where will you go?
19963,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Benjen,The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I'll do what I can… as long as I can.
19964,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bran Stark,"Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
19965,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Benjen,I wish you both good fortune.
19966,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Meera,Are you sure you're ready for this?
19967,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Bran Stark,I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
19968,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,Ned?
19969,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,Lyanna.
19970,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,Is that you? Is that really you?
19971,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,You're not a dream.
19972,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,"No, I'm not a dream. I'm here. Right here."
19973,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,"I've missed you, big brother."
19974,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,"I've missed you, too."
19975,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,I want to be brave.
19976,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,Shh. You are.
19977,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,I'm not.
19978,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,I don't want to die.
19979,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,You're not going to die.
19980,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,Get her some water!
19981,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,"No, no water."
19982,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Eddard Stark,Is there a maester?
19983,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,"Please. Listen to me, Ned."
19984,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,"If Robert finds out, he'll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
19985,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,"Promise me, Ned. Promise me."
19986,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Vale Knight,You can't expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
19987,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Tormund,We didn't invade. We were invited.
19988,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Vale Knight,Not by me.
19989,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
19990,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Man,"The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
19991,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
19992,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna,"Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. He's my king from this day until his last day."
19993,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Manderly,"Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime. I didn't commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
19994,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Glover,I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
19995,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jon Snow,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
19996,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Glover,There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
19997,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Glover,The King in the North!
19998,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,All,The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
19999,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime Lannister,Come on.
20000,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,"I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms."
20001,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,Qyburn,Long may she reign.
20002,2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,All,Long may she reign.
20003,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder Frey,"You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
20004,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder Frey,"Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!"
20005,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder Frey,"I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!"
20006,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Waldery Frey,Stand together!
20007,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,All,Stand together!
20008,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder,Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
20009,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder,"Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
20010,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder,"Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."
20011,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder,"No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem."
20012,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Walder,Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
20013,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey."
20014,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Edd,You wildlings?
20015,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Meera,"I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
20016,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Edd,How do I know that's true?
20017,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Bran Stark,You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
20018,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Edd,"Okay, come on. Let's get them inside."
20019,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
20020,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Robett,It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
20021,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Not just the boys.
20022,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
20023,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Robett,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
20024,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Lyanna,"I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
20025,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Robett,"Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
20026,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Lyanna,And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
20027,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Lyanna,"We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
20028,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
20029,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,But if we're going to survive this winter together...
20030,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Tormund,You want us to man the castles for you?
20031,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
20032,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Tormund,Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
20033,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
20034,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Yohn,The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
20035,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
20036,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,All,Aye!
20037,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
20038,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,And then they broke faith.
20039,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
20040,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
20041,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
20042,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
20043,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
20044,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Ned Umber.
20045,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Alys Karstark.
20046,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
20047,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Stand.
20048,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
20049,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Ned Alys,Now and always!
20050,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
20051,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,Will you start wearing a crown?
20052,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
20053,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,So I can't question your decisions anymore?
20054,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"Of course you can, but--"
20055,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
20056,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
20057,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
20058,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Thank you.
20059,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"You're good at this, you know."
20060,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,At what?
20061,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,At ruling.
20062,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,No.
20063,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
20064,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,Why are you laughing?
20065,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
20066,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,He never said that to me.
20067,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
20068,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
20069,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
20070,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,I'm not trying to undermine you.
20071,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
20072,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
20073,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,Would that be so terrible?
20074,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Wolkan,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
20075,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
20076,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,What does she want?
20077,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
20078,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
20079,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
20080,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
20081,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
20082,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
20083,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jon Snow,You almost sound as if you admire her.
20084,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,I learned a great deal from her.
20085,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,What is this?
20086,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
20087,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
20088,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"It's ours now, we just have to take it."
20089,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
20090,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"No, not angry."
20091,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Are you afraid of me?
20092,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,Should I be?
20093,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
20094,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,Dragonstone.
20095,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
20096,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Enemies to the east.
20097,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
20098,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
20099,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
20100,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
20101,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
20102,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
20103,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
20104,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
20105,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
20106,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
20107,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"A dynasty for us, then."
20108,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,We never talked about Tommen.
20109,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,There's nothing to say.
20110,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,Our baby boy killed himself.
20111,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
20112,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,Cersei--
20113,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
20114,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
20115,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
20116,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
20117,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
20118,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
20119,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Not all of them.
20120,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"Well, it looks like all of them."
20121,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
20122,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
20123,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
20124,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
20125,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
20126,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
20127,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,A queen.
20128,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
20129,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
20130,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
20131,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
20132,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
20133,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
20134,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
20135,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jaime Lannister,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
20136,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
20137,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,If not the most humble.
20138,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
20139,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,What do you want in return?
20140,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
20141,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,I decline your proposal.
20142,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,Why?
20143,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Cersei Lannister,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
20144,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,You should try it. Feels wonderful.
20145,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Euron Greyjoy,"I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
20146,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,"Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
20147,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,Weigh that.
20148,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.
20149,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
20150,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,What's the weight?
20151,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,"Um, 147."
20152,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
20153,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,I don't remember your proposition.
20154,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
20155,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
20156,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,No.
20157,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,"Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
20158,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
20159,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
20160,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,Sources in the restricted area?
20161,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
20162,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,"So, you believe me."
20163,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
20164,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
20165,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,"We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
20166,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Marwyn,Be a good lad. Clean this up.
20167,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Brienne,Nope.
20168,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Tormund,You're a lucky man.
20169,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Petyr,I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
20170,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
20171,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Petyr,I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
20172,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
20173,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Petyr,What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
20174,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"At the moment, peace and quiet."
20175,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
20176,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Petyr,My lady.
20177,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Brienne,Why is he still here?
20178,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
20179,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Brienne,He wants something.
20180,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sansa Stark,I know exactly what he wants.
20181,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
20182,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
20183,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,It's a new one.
20184,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
20185,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,I don't want to steal your food.
20186,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night."
20187,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,You heading south?
20188,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,King's Landing.
20189,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,Poor girl.
20190,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,"Not so bad, is it?"
20191,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
20192,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
20193,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
20194,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,Worst place in the world.
20195,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,What are you doing in the Riverlands?
20196,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
20197,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,Here you go. Guests first.
20198,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,"Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
20199,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
20200,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,"You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
20201,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
20202,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
20203,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
20204,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,My wife's just had our first baby.
20205,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,Boy or girl?
20206,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
20207,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,I hope it's a girl.
20208,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,Why?
20209,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
20210,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,Are you old enough to drink?
20211,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
20212,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,It's really good.
20213,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Man,"So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
20214,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Arya Stark,I'm going to kill the queen.
20215,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Bad night to be outdoors.
20216,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
20217,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,"You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
20218,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
20219,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Why are you always in such a foul mood?
20220,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Experience.
20221,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,This seems like a good place to spend the night.
20222,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,These people don't want us here.
20223,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
20224,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,I don't like the look of it.
20225,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,"For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
20226,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,I'll tell you what doesn't scare me
20227,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
20228,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,They don't.
20229,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
20230,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,How do you think it ended for them?
20231,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,With death.
20232,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,"Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
20233,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Doesn't matter now.
20234,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,"No, doesn't matter now."
20235,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
20236,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
20237,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
20238,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
20239,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,"Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
20240,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,But there's nothing special about you.
20241,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,You're right about that.
20242,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
20243,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
20244,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,And?
20245,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
20246,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Your Lord.
20247,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
20248,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
20249,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Clegane.
20250,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
20251,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
20252,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
20253,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
20254,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,What do you want?
20255,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Look into the flames.
20256,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,I don't want to look in the damn flames.
20257,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
20258,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
20259,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
20260,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,What do you see?
20261,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Logs burning.
20262,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,Keep looking. What do you see?
20263,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
20264,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,What else?
20265,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
20266,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
20267,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Thousands of them.
20268,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Beric,"Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
20269,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,"What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
20270,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Burying the dead.
20271,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Thoros,You knew these people.
20272,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,Not really.
20273,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sandor,"We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
20274,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Little Sam,Mom.
20275,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Gilly,"You should really sleep, Sam."
20276,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,The dead don't.
20277,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Gilly,Legends of the Long Night.
20278,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
20279,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Gilly,What is it?
20280,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
20281,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Gilly,That's dragonglass?
20282,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
20283,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jorah Mormont,Has she come yet?
20284,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,Who?
20285,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Jorah Mormont,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
20286,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Sam,Haven't heard anything.
20287,2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,Daenerys Targaryen,Shall we begin?
20288,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
20289,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
20290,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,I wish I could remember it.
20291,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
20292,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
20293,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Good.
20294,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Not so many lions.
20295,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
20296,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
20297,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
20298,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
20299,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
20300,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,No.
20301,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
20302,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,I never properly thanked you for that.
20303,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
20304,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
20305,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,I did.
20306,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
20307,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
20308,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
20309,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
20310,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
20311,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
20312,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
20313,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
20314,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
20315,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,Which you turned to your advantage.
20316,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Who gave the order to kill me?
20317,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,King Robert.
20318,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Who hired the assassins?
20319,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
20320,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
20321,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,To keep yourself alive.
20322,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
20323,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
20324,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
20325,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
20326,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"I swear it, my queen."
20327,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
20328,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
20329,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,"Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
20330,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,"Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
20331,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
20332,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,I am called Melisandre.
20333,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
20334,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,"No, it didn't."
20335,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
20336,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
20337,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
20338,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
20339,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,What does your Lord expect from me?
20340,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
20341,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
20342,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
20343,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
20344,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"No, but I like it better."
20345,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
20346,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,"Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow."
20347,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
20348,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,You know him?
20349,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
20350,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Varys,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
20351,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
20352,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,He sounds like quite a man.
20353,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Melisandre,"Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
20354,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
20355,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
20356,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
20357,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
20358,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,Read the last bit.
20359,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
20360,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
20361,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
20362,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Davos,"Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
20363,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,What?
20364,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Davos,"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
20365,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
20366,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Davos,"No, too dangerous."
20367,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,But?
20368,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Davos,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
20369,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Cersei Lannister,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
20370,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Cersei Lannister,"You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
20371,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Cersei Lannister,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
20372,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?"
20373,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Qyburn,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
20374,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,Lord Tarley.
20375,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,"Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son."
20376,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Dickon,"Ser, Jaime."
20377,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,"Rickon, isn't it?"
20378,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Dickon,Dickon.
20379,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,That's it.
20380,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
20381,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
20382,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
20383,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
20384,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
20385,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?"
20386,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
20387,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
20388,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
20389,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Randyll,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
20390,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
20391,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jaime Lannister,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
20392,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
20393,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,How long?
20394,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,"It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20."
20395,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,But how long 'till...
20396,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,"Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer."
20397,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --"
20398,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,Does this look like a baby to you?
20399,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,No.
20400,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
20401,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
20402,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
20403,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,"Come, Samwell."
20404,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
20405,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
20406,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,Mormont?
20407,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
20408,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Qyburn,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
20409,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Cersei Lannister,"No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
20410,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Qyburn,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
20411,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Cersei Lannister,They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
20412,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Qyburn,"Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible."
20413,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Qyburn,"Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
20414,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Qyburn,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever."
20415,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day."
20416,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
20417,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,"It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
20418,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
20419,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
20420,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
20421,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
20422,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Olenna Tyrell,"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
20423,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
20424,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Olenna Tyrell,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
20425,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
20426,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
20427,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
20428,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellia,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
20429,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,You are.
20430,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
20431,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
20432,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Olenna Tyrell,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
20433,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyrion Lannister,The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
20434,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,Do I have your support?
20435,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,You have mine.
20436,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellia,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
20437,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
20438,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Daenerys Targaryen,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
20439,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Olenna Tyrell,"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
20440,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Olenna Tyrell,"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
20441,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,Enter.
20442,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?
20443,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,I will see you when I return.
20444,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,But you don't know when that will be.
20445,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,No one knows.
20446,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,I wish you good fortune.
20447,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,Missandei --
20448,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
20449,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,Why?
20450,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,You know why.
20451,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,I don't.
20452,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,You are my weakness.
20453,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,That's what I am? Your weakness?
20454,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
20455,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,I believe it.
20456,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
20457,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,I do too.
20458,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Grey Worm,No.
20459,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Missandei,I want to see you. Please.
20460,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
20461,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
20462,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,And this one.
20463,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
20464,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,I wanted to ask you --
20465,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,"If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
20466,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
20467,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
20468,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,"We're not poets, Tarley."
20469,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
20470,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,This is your moment. Use it wisely.
20471,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
20472,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
20473,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Oh, you are?"
20474,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
20475,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,Oh.
20476,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Marwyn,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
20477,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,Hello.
20478,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,What are you doing?
20479,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
20480,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
20481,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,Drink this.
20482,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,What is it?
20483,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
20484,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,If you could take off your shirt.
20485,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
20486,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jorah Mormont,Have you ever done this before?
20487,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
20488,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sam Tarly,"Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
20489,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Man,They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
20490,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Man,Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
20491,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Man,"If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
20492,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Man,As long as we get back there before they start.
20493,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Man,One more round. It's a long ride.
20494,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,Ary!
20495,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,"Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?"
20496,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Mmm. This is good.
20497,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
20498,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,I didn't do that.
20499,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,You've been making pies?
20500,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,One or two.
20501,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?
20502,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Big lady?
20503,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
20504,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,She found me.
20505,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,What happened to you Ary?
20506,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,You got any ale?
20507,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,Where are you heading?
20508,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,King's Landing.
20509,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,Why?
20510,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,I heard Cersei's queen now.
20511,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
20512,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Hmm.
20513,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,I can't believe someone could do that.
20514,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Cersei would do that.
20515,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
20516,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
20517,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,No. The Boltons are dead.
20518,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,What?
20519,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
20520,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,You're lying.
20521,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?
20522,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Thanks for the pie.
20523,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
20524,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Thanks.
20525,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
20526,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Hot Pie,"No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor."
20527,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,Come in.
20528,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Wolkan,"A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
20529,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
20530,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
20531,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
20532,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
20533,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
20534,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,"But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
20535,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
20536,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,I know that.
20537,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
20538,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
20539,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yohn Royce,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
20540,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Robett Glover,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
20541,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Lyanna Mormont,"Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north."
20542,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,"You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
20543,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
20544,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
20545,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
20546,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,I'm leaving both in good hands.
20547,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Sansa Stark,Whose?
20548,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
20549,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Petyr Baelish,I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
20550,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Petyr Baelish,"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
20551,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,You don't belong down here.
20552,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Petyr Baelish,Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
20553,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,I have nothing to say to you.
20554,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Petyr Baelish,"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
20555,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Jon Snow,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
20556,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Nymeria?
20557,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
20558,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,Come with me.
20559,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Arya Stark,That's not you.
20560,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Nymeria,You can't have them all. It's not fair.
20561,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Obara,I'm oldest.
20562,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyene,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
20563,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Obara,She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
20564,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Nymeria,The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
20565,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyene,Father got careless. That's what Momma says.
20566,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Obara,"Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma."
20567,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Tyene,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
20568,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,"How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?"
20569,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,A few times. Never stayed long.
20570,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,A boy in every port?
20571,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,"A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."
20572,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,Could we get some more?
20573,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,I thought it wasn't for you.
20574,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,I'm developing a taste for it.
20575,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,He's not your servant.
20576,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Theon Greyjoy,It's fine.
20577,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
20578,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,Once I kill my uncle.
20579,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,"And what will you be, handsome?"
20580,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Theon Greyjoy,Whatever my queen demands.
20581,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
20582,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,"Oh, I see. Your protector."
20583,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,So if someone gets too close to you --
20584,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,He might have to intervene.
20585,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,hold that person back.
20586,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,Until they've made their intentions known.
20587,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
20588,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,Stay here.
20589,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,Euron.
20590,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Yara Greyjoy,Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
20591,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Ellaria,Kill us! Get it over with!
20592,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Euron Greyjoy,Give your uncle a kiss.
20593,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Euron Greyjoy,Theon!
20594,2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,Euron Greyjoy,"Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her."

20598,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
20599,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
20600,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
20601,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
20602,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,Davos Seaworth.
20603,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,and DAVOS shake hands.
20604,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
20605,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,Unluckily for me.
20606,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
20607,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Missandei,Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
20608,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Of course.
20609,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Missandei,"Please, this way."
20610,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,Where are you from? I can't place the accent.
20611,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Missandei,I was born on the Island of Naarth.
20612,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
20613,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,This place has changed.
20614,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
20615,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,She is.
20616,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Does she miss me terribly?
20617,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
20618,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I didn't ask --
20619,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
20620,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,She's starting to let on.
20621,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
20622,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
20623,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
20624,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
20625,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
20626,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,True. But I'm not a Stark.
20627,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
20628,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
20629,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
20630,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.
20631,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
20632,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
20633,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,"Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
20634,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,"Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
20635,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,Why?
20636,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
20637,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,So where will you go?
20638,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,Volantis.
20639,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,"Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
20640,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,"I will return, dear spider. One last time."
20641,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,My Lady --
20642,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Melisandre,"I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
20643,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Missandei,"You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
20644,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,This is Jon Snow.
20645,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,He's King in the North.
20646,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
20647,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
20648,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,"Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord."
20649,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Forgive me --
20650,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
20651,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
20652,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
20653,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
20654,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Forever.
20655,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
20656,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I am not.
20657,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
20658,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
20659,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
20660,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
20661,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Then why are you here?
20662,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Because I need your help and you need mine.
20663,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
20664,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I did.
20665,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
20666,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,They're hard to miss.
20667,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"But still, I need your help?"
20668,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
20669,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Almost.
20670,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
20671,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
20672,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
20673,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,You told me you liked this man.
20674,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I do.
20675,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
20676,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
20677,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
20678,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
20679,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
20680,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,The dead?
20681,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Is that another figure of speech?
20682,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
20683,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,The Army of the Dead?
20684,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
20685,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
20686,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
20687,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,we're finished.
20688,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
20689,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
20690,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
20691,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
20692,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
20693,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,whatever you saw beyond the wall.
20694,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
20695,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
20696,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
20697,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Davos,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
20698,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
20699,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
20700,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
20701,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
20702,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,And why would I do that?
20703,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
20704,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
20705,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
20706,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Am I your prisoner?
20707,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Not yet.
20708,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
20709,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,And?
20710,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
20711,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,All of them?
20712,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Captain,Your sister's dead?
20713,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Theon Greyjoy,Euron has her.
20714,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Captain,You saw him take her? And you got away?
20715,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Theon Greyjoy,I couldn't save her. I tried.
20716,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Captain,You wouldn't be here if you tried.
20717,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.
20718,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
20719,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,Oh no!
20720,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,What a twat.
20721,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
20722,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,I give you --
20723,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.
20724,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
20725,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,A bit more than a true friend.
20726,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
20727,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,There's only one reward I want.
20728,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,You shall have what your heart desires --
20729,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,when the war is won.
20730,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
20731,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,"There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know."
20732,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
20733,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,"Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
20734,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,Advice?
20735,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?
20736,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Euron Greyjoy,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later."
20737,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
20738,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
20739,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,It doesn't matter now.
20740,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
20741,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,I imagine she is your favorite.
20742,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
20743,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
20744,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
20745,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
20746,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
20747,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
20748,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyene,Momma!
20749,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
20750,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Qyburn,The Long Farewell.
20751,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,That's the one.
20752,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,How long does the poison take?
20753,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Qyburn,"Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
20754,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,But death is certain?
20755,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Qyburn,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
20756,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
20757,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
20758,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,No.
20759,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,Don't.
20760,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
20761,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
20762,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Messenger,"Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
20763,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
20764,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Messenger,"At once, Your Grace."
20765,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,"No, thank you."
20766,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man."
20767,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
20768,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
20769,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
20770,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
20771,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
20772,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,"Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be."
20773,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
20774,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
20775,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
20776,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
20777,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20778,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
20779,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
20780,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
20781,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
20782,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
20783,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
20784,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
20785,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tycho,Your father's daughter indeed.
20786,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Cersei Lannister,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
20787,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
20788,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I'm a prisoner on this island.
20789,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
20790,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Except to my ship. They took my ship.
20791,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
20792,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
20793,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
20794,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
20795,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,You probably don't believe me.
20796,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I do actually.
20797,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
20798,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
20799,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
20800,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Good question.
20801,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
20802,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
20803,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
20804,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
20805,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
20806,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
20807,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
20808,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,What do you mean?
20809,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
20810,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Dragonglass?
20811,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
20812,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
20813,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
20814,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
20815,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
20816,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
20817,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
20818,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Which wise man said this?
20819,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,I don't remember.
20820,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
20821,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
20822,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
20823,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
20824,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Amazing thing to see.
20825,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
20826,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,You lost two brothers as well?
20827,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
20828,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,You've been talking to Tyrion?
20829,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,He is my Hand.
20830,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,He enjoys talking.
20831,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,We all enjoy what we're good at.
20832,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I don't.
20833,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
20834,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I never expected that you would.
20835,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
20836,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,I haven't either.
20837,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
20838,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,Thank you.
20839,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jon Snow,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
20840,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
20841,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,How much do we have?
20842,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Wolkan,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
20843,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,What does that mean?
20844,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Yohn,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
20845,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
20846,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Wolkan,I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
20847,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
20848,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Wolkan,"No, My Lady, most likely not."
20849,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
20850,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Yohn,"Very wise, My Lady."
20851,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
20852,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
20853,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Yohn,"No, My Lady."
20854,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
20855,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Yohn,"They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady."
20856,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Yohn,"You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
20857,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Petyr Baelish,Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
20858,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,So they should be.
20859,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Petyr Baelish,I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
20860,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
20861,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Petyr Baelish,I only meant to say --
20862,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
20863,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Petyr Baelish,"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
20864,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Petyr Baelish,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
20865,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Guard,"Lady Sansa, at the gate."
20866,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,"Hello, Sansa."
20867,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,I wish Jon was here.
20868,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,Yes. I need to speak to him.
20869,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
20870,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.
20871,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,I don't know what that means.
20872,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,It's difficult to explain.
20873,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"Try, please, for me."
20874,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,"It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
20875,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,How do you know all of this?
20876,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,The three-eyed raven taught me.
20877,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
20878,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,I told you it's difficult to explain.
20879,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,Bran --
20880,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
20881,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sansa Stark,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
20882,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Bran Stark,I'll stay a bit longer.
20883,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,Hmm.
20884,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,Hmm. Does it hurt?
20885,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,A bit. Less than before.
20886,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,The infection no longer appears to be active.
20887,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
20888,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
20889,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,And the climate.
20890,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,"The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
20891,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
20892,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,How bad is it?
20893,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
20894,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,Where will you go?
20895,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
20896,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,I owe my life to her and you.
20897,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
20898,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jorah Mormont,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
20899,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,I hope they do.
20900,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,You treated him?
20901,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,Yes.
20902,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,Who told you to treat him?
20903,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,No one.
20904,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
20905,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,I seem to remember you.
20906,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,But you treated him anyway?
20907,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,I did.
20908,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?"
20909,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,I read the books and followed the instructions.
20910,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.
20911,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Sam Tarly,"Thank you, Archmaester."
20912,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,Come here.
20913,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.
20914,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Marwyn,You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.
20915,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
20916,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
20917,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
20918,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
20919,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
20920,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Missandei,They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.
20921,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,It's too great a risk. You're too important.
20922,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Daenerys Targaryen,What about Casterly Rock?
20923,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,The Unsullied will be there soon.
20924,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Missandei,And what will they face?
20925,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Varys,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
20926,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
20927,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,No one has ever taken the rock.
20928,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
20929,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,They will be ready.
20930,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Man,Draw! Loose!
20931,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
20932,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
20933,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
20934,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
20935,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
20936,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
20937,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
20938,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Tyrion Lannister,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
20939,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Unsullied,There are none left.
20940,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Grey Worm,There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.
20941,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Grey Worm,Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
20942,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,It's done?
20943,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,It is.
20944,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
20945,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,I suppose as well as can be expected.
20946,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
20947,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
20948,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,So you'll just let them take it?
20949,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
20950,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
20951,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
20952,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,Yes. You must be very wise by now.
20953,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,My father always said I was a slow learner.
20954,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
20955,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
20956,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,Widow's Wail.
20957,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
20958,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
20959,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
20960,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
20961,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
20962,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, it has."
20963,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
20964,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,I think we're done here.
20965,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,How will it happen?
20966,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
20967,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,Will there be pain?
20968,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Jaime Lannister,No. I made sure of that.
20969,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,That's good.
20970,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Olenna Tyrell,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."
20971,2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,End,CREDITS
20972,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Halt that wagon!
20973,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
20974,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
20975,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
20976,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,There is no more High Septon.
20977,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"No, there isn't, is there?"
20978,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,There is still the question of my prize.
20979,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
20980,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
20981,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,It's not a castle.
20982,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,turns and points to Highgarden.
20983,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,How about that one? It's available.
20984,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,You don't want Highgarden.
20985,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,I beg to differ.
20986,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
20987,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
20988,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
20989,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
20990,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Right. Just not to me.
20991,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
20992,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
20993,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Stranger things have happened.
20994,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Like what?
20995,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
20996,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
20997,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,The current harvest?
20998,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
20999,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,looks over to BRONN.
21000,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
21001,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
21002,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
21003,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,My Lord.
21004,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,My Lord.
21005,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.
21006,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
21007,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,"I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
21008,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,"You're too kind, My Lord."
21009,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,"I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --"
21010,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
21011,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
21012,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
21013,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
21014,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
21015,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
21016,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
21017,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
21018,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Cersei Lannister,That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
21019,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tycho,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
21020,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
21021,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,This is for you.
21022,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
21023,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
21024,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,"reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
21025,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
21026,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Do you know who this belonged to?
21027,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
21028,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
21029,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
21030,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Chaos is a ladder.
21031,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.
21032,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
21033,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,stands up to leave.
21034,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,I'm not Lord Stark.
21035,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Petyr Baelish,bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
21036,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
21037,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,What's that?
21038,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
21039,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,It's a very good idea.
21040,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,You're leaving?
21041,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore."
21042,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,"No, I don't."
21043,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,That's all you've got to say?
21044,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Thank you.
21045,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,Thank you?
21046,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,For helping me.
21047,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!
21048,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,"I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
21049,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,begins to cry.
21050,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,You died in that cave.
21051,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Meera,"turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."
21052,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
21053,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,"Hey, oh. Where are you going?"
21054,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,In there. I live here.
21055,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,Fuck off.
21056,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
21057,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,Arya Stark is dead.
21058,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
21059,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,There's no Rodrick here.
21060,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,Maester's name is Wolkan.
21061,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother"
21062,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,He's a thousand miles away.
21063,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,"It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off."
21064,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,Mm-hmm.
21065,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
21066,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,"The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
21067,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Which Lady Stark?
21068,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.
21069,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Tell Sansa her sister is home.
21070,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,"Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off."
21071,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.
21072,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
21073,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
21074,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,You sit there. Right there. Don't move.
21075,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.
21076,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.
21077,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,You tell her.
21078,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,I'm not.
21079,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
21080,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
21081,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,sighs.
21082,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,"When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl."
21083,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
21084,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Man,"Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her."
21085,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,You don't have to. I know where she is.
21086,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
21087,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
21088,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,hesitates for a moment.
21089,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Yes.
21090,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
21091,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
21092,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,I didn't run. You need better guards.
21093,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,smirks at ARYA.
21094,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
21095,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
21096,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
21097,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
21098,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,We're not.
21099,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,turns to face SANSA.
21100,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
21101,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,I wish I had.
21102,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
21103,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Your list?
21104,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Of people I'm going to kill.
21105,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.
21106,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,How did you get back to Winterfell?
21107,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
21108,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.
21109,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
21110,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,"No, they're not."
21111,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,"Arya, Bran's home too."
21112,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.
21113,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,is sitting next to the Weirwood tree. SANSA and ARYA approach. BRAN turns to look at them. BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
21114,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,You came home.
21115,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.
21116,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,I saw you at the crossroads.
21117,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,You saw me?
21118,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,I see quite a lot now.
21119,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Bran has visions.
21120,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,I thought you might go to King's Landing.
21121,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,So did I.
21122,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Why would you go back there?
21123,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Cersei is on her list of names.
21124,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
21125,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Who else is on your list?
21126,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Most of them are dead already.
21127,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.
21128,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Where did you get this?
21129,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Littlefinger gave it to me.
21130,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,"Littlefinger, he's here?"
21131,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,turns to look at SANSA.
21132,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,He's declared for House Stark.
21133,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
21134,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Why would he give you a dagger?
21135,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,He thought I'd want it.
21136,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,Why?
21137,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Because it was meant to kill me.
21138,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,The cutthroat after your fall?
21139,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
21140,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
21141,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
21142,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,It doesn't matter.
21143,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
21144,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,I don't want it.
21145,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,holds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.
21146,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
21147,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bran Stark,It's wasted on a cripple.
21148,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
21149,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
21150,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Podrick,Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.
21151,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,I did next to nothing.
21152,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Podrick,"You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
21153,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,I'm not a --
21154,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,pauses for a moment.
21155,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,"Thank you, Podrick."
21156,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
21157,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
21158,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Soon. They will come back to me.
21159,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,He better.
21160,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.
21161,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,What happened?
21162,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,begins smirking.
21163,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,Many things.
21164,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Many things?
21165,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,Your Grace.
21166,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
21167,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,It's all right.
21168,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
21169,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
21170,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
21171,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"So this is it, all we'll ever need."
21172,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
21173,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
21174,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
21175,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,The Children of the Forest made these.
21176,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,When?
21177,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,A very long time ago.
21178,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
21179,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,No.
21180,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
21181,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
21182,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Doing what? Fighting each other?
21183,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
21184,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
21185,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
21186,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
21187,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,turns to look at JON.
21188,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
21189,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"No, I don't think I can."
21190,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,steps forward closer to JON.
21191,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
21192,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
21193,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
21194,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
21195,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
21196,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,What is it?
21197,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,We took Casterly Rock.
21198,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,That's very good to hear.
21199,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
21200,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Isn't it?
21201,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
21202,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
21203,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,We still have the largest army.
21204,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
21205,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
21206,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
21207,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
21208,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,If I've underestimated our enemies --
21209,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
21210,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
21211,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Enough with the clever plans.
21212,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,turns back and looks at TYRION.
21213,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
21214,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,We've discussed this.
21215,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
21216,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,A smart one.
21217,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,looks over to JON SNOW.
21218,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,What do you think I should do?
21219,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,I would never presume to --
21220,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm at war. I'm losing.
21221,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,begins walking close to JON.
21222,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
21223,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
21224,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,glances back towards the dragons.
21225,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
21226,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
21227,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
21228,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,Don't lunge.
21229,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Podrick,pushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
21230,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
21231,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
21232,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,Up.
21233,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
21234,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,And don't --
21235,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
21236,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Podrick,stands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
21237,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,Nice sword. Very nice dagger.
21238,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
21239,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
21240,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
21241,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Sansa Stark,sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
21242,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,It's been awhile since I've trained.
21243,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
21244,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
21245,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,chuckles.
21246,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
21247,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,nods her head in agreement.
21248,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,"Move aside, Podrick."
21249,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Podrick,"backs away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
21250,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,"You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small."
21251,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,I won't cut you. Don't worry.
21252,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
21253,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,I'll try not to.
21254,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,"strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
21255,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Brienne,Who taught you to do that?
21256,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,No one.
21257,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Arya Stark,collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
21258,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
21259,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,What do you think of her?
21260,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,Who?
21261,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,sighs
21262,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,I believe you know of whom I speak.
21263,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,I think she has a good heart.
21264,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
21265,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
21266,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,Fewer.
21267,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,What?
21268,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
21269,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
21270,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,turns to looks at DAVOS and JON.
21271,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
21272,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?"
21273,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,It doesn't matter.
21274,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
21275,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,Of course.
21276,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
21277,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
21278,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,Is the custom different in Naarth?
21279,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
21280,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,The sounds liberating.
21281,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,Why did you leave your homeland?
21282,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,I was stolen away by slavers.
21283,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,I'm sorry.
21284,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
21285,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,She bought me from my master and set me free.
21286,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
21287,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.
21288,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
21289,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
21290,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,You believe that?
21291,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Missandei,"I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose."
21292,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
21293,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
21294,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
21295,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,"GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON."
21296,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,Jon. I didn't know you were here.
21297,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,steps closer to JON.
21298,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,"Sansa, is she all right?"
21299,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
21300,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
21301,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,releases THEON.
21302,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.
21303,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,I should be.
21304,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Davos,Your sister?
21305,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
21306,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jon Snow,The queen is gone.
21307,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Theon Greyjoy,Where did she go?
21308,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
21309,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Good.
21310,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,"We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
21311,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,We are stretched a bit thin.
21312,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,"With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
21313,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
21314,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,"is clearly disappointed. He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers. JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL. BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks. DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation."
21315,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,Ser Jaime.
21316,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Rickon.
21317,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,Dickon.
21318,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
21319,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
21320,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,nods his head in agreement.
21321,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,And?
21322,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,It was glorious.
21323,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Come on. Your father's not here.
21324,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.
21325,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
21326,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,I didn't expect it to smell like that.
21327,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
21328,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,looks over at BRONN
21329,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
21330,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
21331,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,What?
21332,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Listen.
21333,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Spears and shields! Spears and shields!
21334,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Spears and shields!
21335,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,In line now!
21336,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.
21337,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,"Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line."
21338,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Dickon,draws his sword. RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.
21339,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Randyll,Spears armed!
21340,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Get back to King's Landing.
21341,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,I'm not abandoning my army.
21342,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us."
21343,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,We can hold them off.
21344,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys!
21345,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Drogon,breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers. The men burst into flames and start screaming. DICKON looks on in shock. A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
21346,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Hold the line!
21347,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Archers! Archers with me!
21348,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Knock!
21349,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Archers,Knock! Draw!
21350,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Drogon,loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers. DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
21351,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Loose!
21352,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
21353,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Go get it then.
21354,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,I can't shoot with one hand.
21355,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
21356,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
21357,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Come on!
21358,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Where are you?
21359,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
21360,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Guard,Your people can't fight.
21361,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
21362,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,Take cover!
21363,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Drogon,spits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
21364,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Bronn,Come on you fucker.
21365,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Daenerys Targaryen,commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
21366,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,"Flee, you idiot!"
21367,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
21368,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"Come on, boy. Come on!"
21369,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
21370,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Tyrion Lannister,You fucking idiot.
21371,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,Jaime Lannister,"is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
21372,2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,End,CREDITS
21373,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,You could have killed me.
21374,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,What the fuck were you doing back there?
21375,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Ending the war by killing her.
21376,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,You saw the dragon between you and her?
21377,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,looks incredulously at JAIME.
21378,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,And?
21379,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
21380,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,"Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
21381,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,"That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
21382,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,You're fucked.
21383,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Don't you mean we're fucked?
21384,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
21385,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,I have to tell Cersei.
21386,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,pauses and looks at JAIME.
21387,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,Best well jump back in that river.
21388,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
21389,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
21390,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
21391,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
21392,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"Step forward, My Lord."
21393,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
21394,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,You will not kneel?
21395,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,I already have a queen.
21396,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
21397,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,"There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
21398,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
21399,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS.
21400,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
21401,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
21402,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
21403,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Dickon,You will have to kill me too.
21404,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
21405,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,Step back and shut your mouth.
21406,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,Who are you?
21407,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Randyll,A stupid boy.
21408,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Dickon,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
21409,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
21410,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Dickon,looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.
21411,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Dickon,I will not.
21412,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
21413,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
21414,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
21415,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
21416,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm not beheading anyone.
21417,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
21418,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Your Grace --
21419,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
21420,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
21421,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
21422,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys.
21423,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Drogon,draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
21424,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,"is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
21425,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Qyburn,My Lord.
21426,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
21427,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,How many men did we lose?
21428,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,We haven't done a full counting.
21429,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
21430,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,shakes his head.
21431,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
21432,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
21433,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
21434,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,turns and walks away from JAIME.
21435,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
21436,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,He didn't.
21437,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
21438,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
21439,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
21440,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,After all this time it still amazes me --
21441,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
21442,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
21443,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,After.
21444,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,And you believed her?
21445,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
21446,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,"looks away, then sits down."
21447,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
21448,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
21449,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
21450,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
21451,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
21452,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
21453,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
21454,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
21455,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,You weren't gone long.
21456,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,turns back to JON.
21457,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,No.
21458,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,And?
21459,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
21460,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,pauses and doesn't say anything.
21461,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,You're not sure how you feel about that?
21462,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,"No, I'm not."
21463,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
21464,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
21465,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Thousands.
21466,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
21467,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Ser Davos gets carried away.
21468,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,So it was a figure of speech?
21469,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
21470,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,"This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
21471,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,He is my friend.
21472,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,kneels before DAENERYS.
21473,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,Your Grace.
21474,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,stands.
21475,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
21476,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I served with your father. He was a great man.
21477,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,nods to JON.
21478,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,You look strong. You found a cure?
21479,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
21480,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,It would be my honor.
21481,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,steps forward and hugs JORAH.
21482,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bran Stark,s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
21483,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bran Stark,Ravens. We need to send ravens.
21484,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Wolkan,nods his head to BRAN.
21485,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Archmaester,MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
21486,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,"I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
21487,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
21488,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,"The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
21489,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
21490,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam,stops working and turns around.
21491,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
21492,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,Brandon Stark --
21493,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,the crippled boy.
21494,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,Do you know him?
21495,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
21496,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,And?
21497,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
21498,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
21499,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
21500,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,steps forward and clears his throat.
21501,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
21502,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
21503,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
21504,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,"Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
21505,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
21506,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,Archmaester --
21507,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,"That will be all, Tarley."
21508,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam,turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
21509,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,"It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
21510,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
21511,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
21512,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,I'm afraid so.
21513,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Maester,Horrible business.
21514,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
21515,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
21516,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Marwyn,Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
21517,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
21518,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
21519,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
21520,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
21521,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
21522,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,"reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
21523,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
21524,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
21525,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Daenerys is not her father.
21526,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
21527,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
21528,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Who is that for?
21529,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,Jon Snow.
21530,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Did you read it?
21531,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
21532,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
21533,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,What's it say?
21534,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,Nothing good.
21535,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
21536,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
21537,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
21538,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
21539,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
21540,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,interrupts VARYS.
21541,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I need to go home.
21542,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,You said you don't have enough men.
21543,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
21544,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
21545,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
21546,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
21547,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,begins walking around the table closer to JON.
21548,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,So bring the dead to her.
21549,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
21550,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
21551,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Is that possible?
21552,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
21553,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
21554,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
21555,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
21556,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,And how would you get into King's Landing.
21557,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
21558,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,nods his head.
21559,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
21560,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Varys,Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
21561,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
21562,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
21563,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,turns to look at JORAH.
21564,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
21565,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
21566,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
21567,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,They won't have to.
21568,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
21569,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
21570,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,I haven't given you permission to leave.
21571,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
21572,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
21573,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Robett,"The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
21574,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Yohn,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
21575,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
21576,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
21577,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
21578,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
21579,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,"Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
21580,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,These are mother and father's chambers.
21581,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,And?
21582,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,Nothing.
21583,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,Don't do that.
21584,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,turns around to face ARYA.
21585,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,What?
21586,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,Say what you mean.
21587,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
21588,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
21589,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,Are you angry with me?
21590,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
21591,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
21592,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,Their opinions are important to you?
21593,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
21594,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,Not if they lose their heads first.
21595,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
21596,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
21597,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
21598,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
21599,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
21600,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,I have work to do.
21601,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sansa Stark,turns and walks away from ARYA.
21602,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,My lady.
21603,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,exits the room.
21604,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
21605,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
21606,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
21607,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
21608,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
21609,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
21610,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,You're not staying here?
21611,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
21612,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,What if someone takes the boat?
21613,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
21614,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
21615,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
21616,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
21617,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
21618,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,And here I am ready to train.
21619,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Why down here?
21620,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
21621,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
21622,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
21623,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
21624,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,I'll leave you to it.
21625,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Bronn,turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
21626,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
21627,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,remains silent and stares at TYRION.
21628,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
21629,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Don't talk about our father.
21630,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Listen to me --
21631,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
21632,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
21633,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
21634,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,shakes his head and says nothing.
21635,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
21636,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,What do you want?
21637,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
21638,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
21639,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
21640,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
21641,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I thought you might still be rowing.
21642,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
21643,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
21644,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
21645,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
21646,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
21647,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Anybody give you any trouble?
21648,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
21649,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
21650,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,nods.
21651,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
21652,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I think you need to understand --
21653,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,I'm ready. Let's go.
21654,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,You should know what you're heading into.
21655,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
21656,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
21657,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
21658,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,You might want to bring one of those swords.
21659,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
21660,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
21661,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
21662,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,this I know.
21663,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
21664,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
21665,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
21666,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
21667,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Who should I say I am?
21668,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
21669,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
21670,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,You there.
21671,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?"
21672,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Is that your boat?
21673,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,It is.
21674,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
21675,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,The docks are that way.
21676,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
21677,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Still five gold dragons?
21678,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Are you joking?
21679,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,You must be even older than you look. 15.
21680,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,15?
21681,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Apiece.
21682,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
21683,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
21684,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,turns and begins walking back to his boat.
21685,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,What's in the boat?
21686,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,pauses and turns back to the guards.
21687,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Not more gold.
21688,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Wine?
21689,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Mmm.
21690,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,I like wine.
21691,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Or hams.
21692,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Come and have a look.
21693,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Fermented crab.
21694,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,What?
21695,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
21696,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
21697,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
21698,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,"Oi, Dwarf!"
21699,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,quickly walks to cut the guards off.
21700,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
21701,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,That dwarf --
21702,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Where did you get that scar?
21703,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
21704,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
21705,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
21706,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
21707,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Guard,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
21708,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
21709,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
21710,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,This is Gendry.
21711,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,He'll do.
21712,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
21713,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,That won't be necessary.
21714,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Qyburn,bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
21715,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Qyburn,Ser Jaime.
21716,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Qyburn,closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
21717,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Why was QYBURN here?
21718,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
21719,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,I met with Tyrion.
21720,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
21721,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,What did our brother have to say?
21722,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Daenerys wants to meet.
21723,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,To discuss a surrender?
21724,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,To discuss an armistice.
21725,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
21726,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
21727,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,smirks and looks away from JAIME.
21728,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,Are you going to punish him?
21729,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Tyrion?
21730,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,Bronn.
21731,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,looks confused.
21732,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
21733,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,You let it happen. Why?
21734,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
21735,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
21736,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,Who will you say is the father?
21737,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,You.
21738,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,People won't like that.
21739,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
21740,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
21741,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
21742,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jaime Lannister,reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
21743,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Cersei Lannister,Never betray me again.
21744,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
21745,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
21746,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,I understand.
21747,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
21748,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,You don't have to worry.
21749,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
21750,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Understood.
21751,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
21752,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
21753,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
21754,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,You survived King's Landing.
21755,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Yet again.
21756,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,"Your Grace, this is --"
21757,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,steps forward in front of DAVOS.
21758,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son."
21759,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,looks to DAVOS.
21760,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,He was meant to keep that to himself.
21761,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
21762,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
21763,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,I met yours in my shop.
21764,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,You're a lot leaner.
21765,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,You're a lot shorter.
21766,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
21767,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,I grew up on stories about them.
21768,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you."
21769,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
21770,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
21771,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Do you know how to use one?
21772,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,shakes his head.
21773,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,"Well, that's a problem."
21774,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,I prefer a hammer.
21775,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,looks to DAVOS.
21776,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,He can handle himself.
21777,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,nods.
21778,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,We could use the help.
21779,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
21780,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,"I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
21781,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
21782,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
21783,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
21784,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
21785,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
21786,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
21787,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tyrion Lannister,Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
21788,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
21789,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
21790,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,"Your Grace, I --"
21791,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
21792,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
21793,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,smiles.
21794,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,But I've grown used to him.
21795,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
21796,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Daenerys Targaryen,nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
21797,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Heave!
21798,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam,is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
21799,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
21800,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam,No.
21801,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,"15,782."
21802,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam,looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.
21803,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
21804,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,looks away and pauses.
21805,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,None anymore.
21806,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,"That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does ""annulment"" mean?"
21807,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
21808,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --
21809,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.
21810,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
21811,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,Steps. That number was steps.
21812,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,is dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
21813,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam,"is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
21814,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,is loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
21815,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gilly,Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.
21816,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sam Tarly,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
21817,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
21818,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
21819,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Arya Stark,"is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men."
21820,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Wolkan,"I found it, my Lord."
21821,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Wolkan,hands BAELISH a raven scroll.
21822,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Wolkan,It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
21823,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Petyr Baelish,reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
21824,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Petyr Baelish,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
21825,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Wolkan,"Yes, my Lord."
21826,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Petyr Baelish,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
21827,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Wolkan,"turns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents."
21828,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
21829,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,"JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation."
21830,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
21831,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I've been failing at that job of late.
21832,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,How many queens are there now?
21833,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Two.
21834,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
21835,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Both.
21836,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,How many men did you bring?
21837,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,looks around the table.
21838,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,Not enough.
21839,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,The big woman?
21840,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
21841,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,We were hoping some of your men could help.
21842,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.
21843,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,nods his head.
21844,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,You are.
21845,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,turns to look at JON.
21846,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,You really want to go out there again?
21847,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,You're not the only ones.
21848,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.
21849,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
21850,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sandor,pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
21851,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
21852,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Beric,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming."
21853,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.
21854,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
21855,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,Thoros?
21856,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Thoros,sits up from a dark corner.
21857,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,I hardly recognized you.
21858,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Thoros,Ser Jorah Mormont --
21859,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
21860,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Thoros,They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
21861,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
21862,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,He was my father.
21863,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,He hunted us like animals.
21864,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
21865,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Beric,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
21866,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Davos,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
21867,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Beric,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
21868,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Beric,stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
21869,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Beric,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
21870,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Sandor,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?"
21871,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jorah Mormont,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
21872,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Thoros,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
21873,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,He's right. We're all on the same side.
21874,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Gendry Baratheon,How can we be?
21875,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Jon Snow,We're all breathing.
21876,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,Tormund,hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.
21877,2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,End,CREDITS
21878,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Are you all right?
21879,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,faces JON and grunts.
21880,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Ever been north before?
21881,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,Never seen snow before.
21882,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit."
21883,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,You've never been down south.
21884,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,I've been to Winterfell.
21885,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,That's the north.
21886,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
21887,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,"You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
21888,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
21889,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
21890,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,We have to make due with what we've got.
21891,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
21892,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,This one is maybe not so smart.
21893,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
21894,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Good. That's more important than being smart.
21895,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,looks at JON as they continue to walk.
21896,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?"
21897,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
21898,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?"
21899,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Thoros,"Are you still mad at us, boy?"
21900,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,You sold me to a witch.
21901,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Thoros,"Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
21902,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
21903,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,"I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
21904,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Sounds all right so far.
21905,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,and put leeches on me.
21906,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Was she naked too?
21907,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Thoros,She needed your blood.
21908,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,Yes. Thank you. I know that.
21909,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
21910,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,It could have been worse.
21911,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
21912,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,"But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?"
21913,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Gendry Baratheon,I'm not whinging.
21914,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
21915,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,motions to BERIC.
21916,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
21917,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
21918,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Thoros,Good lad.
21919,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
21920,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
21921,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
21922,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
21923,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
21924,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,Your father wanted to execute me.
21925,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I heard.
21926,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
21927,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,and JON glance at each other.
21928,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
21929,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,Me too.
21930,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
21931,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
21932,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
21933,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
21934,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
21935,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
21936,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,"pauses, then nods at JON."
21937,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,He gave it to you.
21938,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I'm not his son.
21939,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,"pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
21940,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
21941,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
21942,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jorah Mormont,I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
21943,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
21944,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,I remember.
21945,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
21946,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,starts a slow clap.
21947,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
21948,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,turns to look at ARYA.
21949,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,What?
21950,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
21951,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
21952,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,You don't have to read it. I remember.
21953,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
21954,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,They forced me to do it.
21955,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
21956,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
21957,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
21958,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,They told me it was the only way to save father.
21959,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
21960,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,You were there?
21961,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
21962,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
21963,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I wanted to.
21964,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,But you didn't. Just like me.
21965,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
21966,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
21967,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I was training.
21968,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
21969,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
21970,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,You never would have survived what I survived.
21971,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I guess we'll never know.
21972,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,What are you doing to do with that letter.
21973,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,I don't know yet.
21974,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
21975,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
21976,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,Arya --
21977,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
21978,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
21979,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
21980,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sansa Stark,You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
21981,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
21982,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Arya Stark,turns and walks away.
21983,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,You're the one they call the dog.
21984,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Fuck off.
21985,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
21986,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
21987,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,looks up at TORMUND.
21988,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Gingers I hate.
21989,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
21990,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.
21991,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
21992,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
21993,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
21994,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,I didn't trip. I was pushed.
21995,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Ever since you've been mean.
21996,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Will you fuck off?
21997,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
21998,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,stops and turns to TORMUND.
21999,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
22000,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Dick?
22001,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Cock.
22002,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Ah. Dick. I like it.
22003,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,I bet you do.
22004,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,"turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
22005,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
22006,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,stops and glances at TORMUND.
22007,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,Brienne of Tarth.
22008,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,You know her?
22009,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
22010,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
22011,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
22012,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,nods.
22013,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,You do know her.
22014,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,We've met.
22015,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,and TORMUND begin walking.
22016,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
22017,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
22018,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tormund,I'm good at killing people.
22019,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,You don't much look like him.
22020,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Who's that?
22021,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
22022,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,You knew him?
22023,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
22024,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I serve the north.
22025,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
22026,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
22027,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,He wants you alive.
22028,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Why?
22029,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,I don't know.
22030,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
22031,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
22032,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,So what are you fighting for?
22033,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
22034,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,But we all die.
22035,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
22036,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
22037,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Beric,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
22038,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow,Aye. Maybe that's enough.
22039,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
22040,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,That's what I saw in the fire.
22041,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,points towards the mountain.
22042,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,A mountain like an arrowhead.
22043,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Thoros,Are you sure?
22044,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,turns to THOROS and nods his head.
22045,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Sandor,We're getting close.
22046,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
22047,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Daenerys Targaryen,Do you know what I like about you?
22048,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,turns to look at DAENERYS.
22049,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,I honestly don't.
22050,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Daenerys Targaryen,You're not a hero.
22051,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
22052,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Daenerys Targaryen,walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
22053,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
22054,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Daenerys Targaryen,"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
22055,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
22056,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Daenerys Targaryen,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
22057,2017-08-20,Season 7,Episode 6,Beyond the Wall,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
22058,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,Oil?
22059,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Soldier,"Pitch, my lord."
22060,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,How many barrels?
22061,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Soldier,"500, my lord."
22062,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,Get 500 more.
22063,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Soldier,"Yes, my lord."
22064,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
22065,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,The thrill will fade.
22066,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
22067,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Gold?
22068,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
22069,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Family.
22070,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"Not without a cock, you don't."
22071,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
22072,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"Yet, your brother--"
22073,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
22074,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
22075,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,"Archers, stand tall!"
22076,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,Cover that wall!
22077,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,How many people live here?
22078,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"A million, give or take."
22079,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
22080,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
22081,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Why isn't she with them?
22082,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Qyburn,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her."
22083,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,And the rest of them?
22084,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Qyburn,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.
22085,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Including our brother.
22086,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Qyburn,"Yes, Your Grace."
22087,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
22088,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Missandei,Why did they build it?
22089,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jorah Mormont,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
22090,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
22091,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Davos,Maybe it still is.
22092,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
22093,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
22094,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
22095,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Podrick,"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
22096,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
22097,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Podrick,Hard to blame you.
22098,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,Cersei will anyway.
22099,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Podrick,I'm glad you're alive.
22100,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
22101,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Soldier,What's in there?
22102,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,Fuck off.
22103,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,I thought you were dead.
22104,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,Not yet. You came pretty close.
22105,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,I was only trying to protect her.
22106,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,You and me both.
22107,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,She's alive. Arya.
22108,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,Where?
22109,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,Winterfell.
22110,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,Who's protecting her if you're here?
22111,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
22112,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,It won't be me.
22113,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
22114,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Podrick,"It is, my lord."
22115,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
22116,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,I'm sure your new queen--
22117,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,You've been thinking about our new queen.
22118,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Varys,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
22119,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
22120,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
22121,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
22122,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,It's good to see you again.
22123,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"Yeah, you, too."
22124,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,"Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first."
22125,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bronn,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
22126,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
22127,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,You might.
22128,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
22129,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
22130,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sandor,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
22131,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Where is she?
22132,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,She'll be here soon.
22133,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Didn't travel with you?
22134,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,No.
22135,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,We've been here for some time.
22136,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,My apologies.
22137,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,We are all facing a unique
22138,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,Theon! I have your sister
22139,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
22140,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
22141,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
22142,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
22143,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
22144,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,Why?
22145,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Sit down or leave.
22146,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
22147,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
22148,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,We all know that will never happen.
22149,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Then why are we here?
22150,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
22151,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
22152,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
22153,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
22154,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,Yes. That's all.
22155,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
22156,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
22157,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,The word of a would-be usurper.
22158,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
22159,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,We can destroy them by burning them.
22160,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
22161,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
22162,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
22163,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,How many?
22164,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,"A hundred thousand, at least."
22165,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,Can they swim?
22166,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,No.
22167,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
22168,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,What are you talking about?
22169,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,"I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
22170,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Euron Greyjoy,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
22171,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
22172,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"In return, the King"
22173,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,Just the King
22174,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
22175,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
22176,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
22177,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,Ser Jaime.
22178,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
22179,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
22180,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
22181,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
22182,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Fuck loyalty?
22183,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brienne,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
22184,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,And tell her what?
22185,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Davos,I wish you hadn't done that.
22186,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
22187,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,I know!
22188,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
22189,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
22190,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
22191,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Davos,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
22192,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
22193,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
22194,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
22195,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,I did this. I should go.
22196,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
22197,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,You spoke with her?
22198,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
22199,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
22200,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
22201,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
22202,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
22203,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
22204,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I didn't know about that.
22205,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
22206,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"Cersei, I didn't know."
22207,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,the destruction of this family.
22208,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
22209,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,You killed our father
22210,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
22211,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
22212,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I have never been more sorry about anything.
22213,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"I will not hear it, not from you."
22214,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,I will not hear it!
22215,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
22216,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
22217,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
22218,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,I will not
22219,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
22220,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
22221,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
22222,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
22223,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
22224,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
22225,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,"Mm, not like this."
22226,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
22227,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,Yes.
22228,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Why?
22229,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
22230,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
22231,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
22232,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
22233,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
22234,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tyrion Lannister,You're pregnant.
22235,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,No one is less happy about this than I am.
22236,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
22237,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
22238,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
22239,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,I can't have children.
22240,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,Who told you that?
22241,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,The witch who murdered my husband.
22242,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
22243,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
22244,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"So, what now?"
22245,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
22246,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
22247,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
22248,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
22249,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
22250,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
22251,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
22252,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
22253,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,What does that have to do with anything?
22254,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
22255,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,You think he wants to marry her?
22256,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
22257,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
22258,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
22259,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
22260,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
22261,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
22262,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,She's your sister
22263,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
22264,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,Why did she come to Winterfell?
22265,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
22266,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
22267,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
22268,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"And after she murders you, what does she become?"
22269,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,Lady
22270,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
22271,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
22272,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jorah Mormont,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
22273,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
22274,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Daenerys Targaryen,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
22275,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,Jon.
22276,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,Can I speak with you?
22277,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,All right.
22278,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
22279,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
22280,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
22281,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
22282,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
22283,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,No. Not compared to you.
22284,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
22285,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,Our father was more of a father.
22286,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,He was.
22287,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
22288,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,I did.
22289,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
22290,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,But the things I've done.
22291,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
22292,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now."
22293,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jon Snow,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
22294,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,"Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
22295,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
22296,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,Your sister--
22297,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,She's not dead.
22298,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,"She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
22299,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,She's our queen
22300,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,She's your sister
22301,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,I did. I ran from my uncle.
22302,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,"So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
22303,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,We're done with all that.
22304,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,Who says we are?
22305,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
22306,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,"Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
22307,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,He needs to shut his mouth.
22308,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,Hey!
22309,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,"Oh, yes!"
22310,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,That's more like it.
22311,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,Stay down or I'll kill you!
22312,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Harrag,I said stay down or I'll kill you!
22313,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon Greyjoy,Not for me. For Yara!
22314,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Men,Yara!
22315,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,Have my sister
22316,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,Are you sure you want to do this?
22317,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
22318,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,And what does honor demand?
22319,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
22320,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,"All right, then. Get on with it."
22321,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
22322,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,My sister asked you a question.
22323,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
22324,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
22325,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I did it to protect you.
22326,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
22327,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,Whatever your aunt
22328,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
22329,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I know of no such letter.
22330,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
22331,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
22332,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,You held a knife to his throat.
22333,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,"You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
22334,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,You told our mother
22335,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
22336,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
22337,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
22338,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
22339,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"Sansa, please."
22340,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
22341,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
22342,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
22343,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,John Royce,I think not.
22344,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
22345,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"And yet, you betrayed her."
22346,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,I loved you. More than anyone.
22347,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"And yet, you betrayed me."
22348,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
22349,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Petyr Baelish,Sansa! I--
22350,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
22351,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
22352,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
22353,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Ser Jaime.
22354,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Your Grace.
22355,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
22356,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Men,Your Grace.
22357,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,What are you doing?
22358,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Preparing the expedition north.
22359,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
22360,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
22361,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
22362,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
22363,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
22364,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
22365,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
22366,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,I made a promise.
22367,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Our child will rule Westeros.
22368,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
22369,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
22370,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,And then what?
22371,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,And then we rule.
22372,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
22373,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
22374,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
22375,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
22376,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Two.
22377,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,What happened to the third?
22378,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
22379,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
22380,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
22381,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--"
22382,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
22383,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
22384,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
22385,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
22386,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,I didn't conspire with him.
22387,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
22388,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
22389,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,And that will be treason.
22390,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Treason?
22391,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,Disobeying your queen
22392,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
22393,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,I told you no one walks away from me.
22394,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father"
22395,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Cersei Lannister,There's one more yet to come.
22396,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,"Give the order, then."
22397,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime Lannister,I don't believe you.
22398,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,Come in.
22399,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,Samwell Tarly.
22400,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
22401,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,I remember everything.
22402,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
22403,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
22404,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
22405,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,Oh! I don't know what that means.
22406,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
22407,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
22408,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in a vision?
22409,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,Oh.
22410,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,He needs to know the truth.
22411,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,The truth about what?
22412,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.
22413,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,It's not.
22414,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,Dornish bastards are named Sand.
22415,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
22416,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,Are you certain?
22417,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sam,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
22418,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Rhaegar,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days."
22419,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Lyanna,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
22420,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.
22421,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,He loved her. And she loved him.
22422,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,And Jon - Jon's real name.
22423,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Lyanna,His name is Aegon.
22424,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Bran Stark,He's never been a bastard.
22425,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Brans Voice,He needs to know. We need to tell him.
22426,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,Are you all right?
22427,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
22428,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,You did the right thing.
22429,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,You did it.
22430,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
22431,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,Does that bother you?
22432,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
22433,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
22434,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
22435,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
22436,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
22437,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,Father
22438,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Arya Stark,I miss him.
22439,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Sansa Stark,"Me, too."
22440,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Beric,It's a long way down.
22441,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tormund,Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
22442,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,"I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!"
22443,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Man,What is it?
22444,2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Tormund,Come on! Run! Run!
22445,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
22446,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Varys,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
22447,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
22448,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
22449,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Look at you.
22450,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,You're a man.
22451,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bran Stark,Almost.
22452,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Where's Arya?
22453,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,Lurking somewhere.
22454,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
22455,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
22456,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
22457,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bran Stark,We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
22458,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bran Stark,"He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
22459,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
22460,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Umber,"We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
22461,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Umber,And my lord.
22462,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Umber,And my queen. Sorry.
22463,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
22464,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
22465,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Maester Wolkan,"At once, Your Grace."
22466,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Lyanna Mormont,Your Grace.
22467,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Lyanna,But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.
22468,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Lyanna,A lord? Nothing at all?
22469,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,It's not important.
22470,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Lyanna,Not important? We named you King in the North.
22471,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Man,King of the North!
22472,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
22473,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
22474,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
22475,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
22476,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Whatever they want.
22477,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
22478,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Man,Sorry 'bout that.
22479,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,Are these the last of the wagons?
22480,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Man,Aye.
22481,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"All right, let's get it all to the forges."
22482,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,My lord. My lady.
22483,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Royce,My lady.
22484,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
22485,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
22486,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
22487,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,It had its moments.
22488,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,Apologies for leaving like that.
22489,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
22490,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,We both survived.
22491,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
22492,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
22493,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
22494,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,She did.
22495,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,And you believed her?
22496,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
22497,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
22498,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,You used to be taller.
22499,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,How did you sneak up on me?
22500,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
22501,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I didn't.
22502,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,You still have it.
22503,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Needle.
22504,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Have you ever used it?
22505,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Once or twice.
22506,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Valyrian steel.
22507,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Jealous?
22508,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Too heavy for me.
22509,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
22510,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
22511,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
22512,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
22513,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Now you're defending her?
22514,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,You?
22515,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,I'm defending our family. So is she.
22516,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Yeah. I'm her family too.
22517,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Don't forget that.
22518,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,"Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
22519,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Good.
22520,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
22521,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
22522,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
22523,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
22524,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Are we in King's Landing?
22525,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Mm.
22526,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,You picked the losing side.
22527,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
22528,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
22529,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
22530,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Harry,"Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
22531,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
22532,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,Horses?
22533,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Harry,Two thousand.
22534,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,And elephants?
22535,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Harry,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
22536,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
22537,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Harry,"They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
22538,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
22539,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Harry,"We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
22540,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Am I most welcome here?
22541,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
22542,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
22543,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,I was hoping we could talk in private.
22544,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,After the war. That was our agreement.
22545,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Wars sometimes last years.
22546,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
22547,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,How?
22548,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
22549,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
22550,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,They were lesser men.
22551,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dirah,I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
22552,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
22553,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dirah,"Archie, was it?"
22554,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,And William.
22555,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dirah,Tall handsome William?
22556,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,"Yeah, tall handsome William."
22557,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dirah,They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
22558,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
22559,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,Did you?
22560,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,Nearly killed it.
22561,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Marei,That's brave.
22562,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,That boy Eddie.
22563,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dirah,The ginger?
22564,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
22565,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dirah,How does he sleep with no eyelids?
22566,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
22567,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
22568,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,You're kidding me.
22569,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,"Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
22570,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
22571,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Crayah,You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
22572,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
22573,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,Which girl?
22574,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
22575,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
22576,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,"That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
22577,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
22578,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
22579,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
22580,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
22581,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
22582,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bronn,That fucking family.
22583,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Qyburn,"When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
22584,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,I wanted those elephants.
22585,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
22586,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,You're insulting my late husband?
22587,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Are you offended?
22588,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
22589,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,And the Kingslayer?
22590,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
22591,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Life is boring.
22592,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,"You're not boring, I'll give you that."
22593,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,Do I please the queen?
22594,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
22595,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Cersei Lannister,But now I want to be alone.
22596,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Euron Greyjoy,I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
22597,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,"Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
22598,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,We can take our home back.
22599,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,Daenerys went north.
22600,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
22601,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,You're my queen. I go where you command.
22602,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
22603,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Theon Greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
22604,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Yara Greyjoy,But kill the bastards anyway.
22605,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Wolkan,"Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
22606,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Varys,The Karstarks.
22607,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
22608,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Davos,Can't argue with that.
22609,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Davos,"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
22610,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,And our queen is grateful.
22611,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Davos,"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
22612,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
22613,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Davos,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
22614,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,They do make a handsome couple.
22615,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Varys,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
22616,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,I'm not that old.
22617,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Not as old as him.
22618,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
22619,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Varys,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
22620,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister,What is that?
22621,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Varys,Nothing lasts.
22622,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Your sister doesn't like me.
22623,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
22624,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
22625,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,How many today?
22626,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Dothraki Man,Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
22627,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What's the matter?
22628,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,The dragons are barely eating.
22629,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What's wrong with them?
22630,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,They don't like the North.
22631,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Go on.
22632,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I don't know how to ride a dragon.
22633,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
22634,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What if he doesn't want me to?
22635,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
22636,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What do I hold onto?
22637,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Whatever you can.
22638,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,You've completely ruined horses for me.
22639,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,We could stay a thousand years-
22640,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,No one would find us.
22641,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,We'd be pretty old.
22642,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,It's cold up here for a southern girl.
22643,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,So keep your queen warm.
22644,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Don't be afraid.
22645,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Man,Gendry?
22646,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Man,He's here.
22647,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
22648,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sandor,"You're saying you're good, is that it?"
22649,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
22650,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sandor,You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
22651,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Leave him be.
22652,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sandor,I heard you were here. You left me to die.
22653,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,First I robbed you.
22654,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sandor,"You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
22655,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
22656,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"Yeah, thanks. So have you."
22657,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"I mean, you look good."
22658,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Thanks. So do you.
22659,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
22660,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,"Stay close to that forge, then."
22661,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"Is that a command, Lady Stark?"
22662,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Don't call me that.
22663,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,"As you wish, milady."
22664,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Here's my wish.
22665,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Can you make it?
22666,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,What do you need something like this for?
22667,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,Can you make it or not?
22668,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,You already have a sword. What's that?
22669,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Gendry Baratheon,It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
22670,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Arya Stark,You don't know any other rich girls.
22671,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,Come in.
22672,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
22673,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
22674,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
22675,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,The King in the North.
22676,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I told you we needed allies.
22677,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
22678,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
22679,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,And a Targaryen queen.
22680,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
22681,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Do you have any faith in me at all?
22682,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,You know I do.
22683,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
22684,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,"No, she's much prettier."
22685,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sansa Stark,Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
22686,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Oh!
22687,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,So you're the man?
22688,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
22689,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
22690,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jorah Mormont,"They could, they just wouldn't."
22691,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
22692,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
22693,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, there must be something I could give you."
22694,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
22695,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,For what crime?
22696,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
22697,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,And also a sword.
22698,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,From the Citadel?
22699,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
22700,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"It wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
22701,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Not Randyll Tarly?
22702,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,You know him?
22703,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
22704,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
22705,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Your brother stood with your father.
22706,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?"
22707,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Daenerys Targaryen,Of course.
22708,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,What are you doing out here?
22709,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bran Stark,"Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
22710,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
22711,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Bran Stark,I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
22712,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Sam?
22713,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
22714,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Were you hiding from me?
22715,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Of course not.
22716,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
22717,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
22718,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,She's good.
22719,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Little Sam?
22720,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Don't you know?
22721,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Know what?
22722,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
22723,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,She didn't tell you.
22724,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
22725,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Would you have done it?
22726,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
22727,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
22728,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I wasn't a king.
22729,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,But you were. You've always been.
22730,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,"I gave up my crown, Sam."
22731,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
22732,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
22733,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
22734,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,What are you talking about?
22735,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
22736,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in."
22737,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
22738,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,"No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
22739,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,Daenerys is our queen.
22740,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,She shouldn't be.
22741,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Jon Snow,That's treason.
22742,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Sam Tarly,It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
22743,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Edd,"Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
22744,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tormund,I've always had blue eyes!
22745,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Beric,Did you find anyone?
22746,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Edd,The Umber boy.
22747,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Beric,It's a message. From the Night King.
22748,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tormund,His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
22749,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Edd,We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
22750,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tormund,"If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
22751,2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,Tormund,We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
22752,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
22753,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
22754,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
22755,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Your sister pledged to send her army north.
22756,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,She did.
22757,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
22758,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
22759,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
22760,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"We""?"
22761,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
22762,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"Your Grace, I know my brother-"
22763,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Like you knew your sister?
22764,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
22765,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
22766,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,"You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
22767,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
22768,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,The things we do for love.
22769,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
22770,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
22771,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,This is about survival.
22772,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"You don't know me well, Your Grace."
22773,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
22774,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
22775,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,You vouch for him?
22776,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,I do.
22777,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,You would fight beside him?
22778,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,I would.
22779,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,"I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
22780,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,What does the Warden of the North say about it?
22781,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,We need every man we can get.
22782,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Very well.
22783,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
22784,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
22785,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I was a fool.
22786,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Not for the first time.
22787,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
22788,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
22789,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,Don't you have something better to do?
22790,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,You make my weapon yet?
22791,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
22792,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
22793,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,It's strong enough.
22794,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
22795,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
22796,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"No, but-"
22797,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,But you're a fighter.
22798,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,I've done my share.
22799,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,You've fought them?
22800,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,I did. Some of them.
22801,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,How many?
22802,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,A few. That was enough.
22803,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,What are they like?
22804,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,Bad. Really bad.
22805,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,"Really bad""?"
22806,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
22807,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
22808,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,I know Death.
22809,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,He's got many faces.
22810,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,I look forward to seeing this one.
22811,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,My weapon?
22812,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,I'll get right on it.
22813,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
22814,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
22815,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I'm not that person anymore.
22816,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,"You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
22817,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,You're not?
22818,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,No. I'm something else now.
22819,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,You're not angry at me.
22820,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,I'm not angry at anyone.
22821,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Why didn't you tell them?
22822,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
22823,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,What about afterwards?
22824,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,How do you know there is an afterwards?
22825,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, here we are."
22826,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, here we are."
22827,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Together again.
22828,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,And the masses rejoice.
22829,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,How do they feel about their new queen?
22830,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,She's your new queen too.
22831,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
22832,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,And she is? Different?
22833,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,She is.
22834,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,You're sure about her?
22835,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I am.
22836,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,She didn't seem sure about you.
22837,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
22838,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Hmm.
22839,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
22840,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Was she lying about the baby too?
22841,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"No, that part is real."
22842,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
22843,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,What?
22844,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
22845,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
22846,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Both,A girl's mouth around-
22847,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Your cock.
22848,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,My cock.
22849,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
22850,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
22851,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,Ser Jaime.
22852,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Lady Brienne.
22853,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,He's come a long way.
22854,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
22855,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
22856,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
22857,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,It is.
22858,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"The rise, it should give us some advantage."
22859,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
22860,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Yes, I think you're right."
22861,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,What are you doing?
22862,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,I think you know.
22863,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I truly don't.
22864,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
22865,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,You want me to insult you?
22866,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,No!
22867,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Good.
22868,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
22869,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,I better get back.
22870,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,"Forgive me, khaleesi."
22871,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Have you done something to offend me?
22872,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,Many things.
22873,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Long ago and long forgiven.
22874,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
22875,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
22876,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,You made the right choice.
22877,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
22878,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
22879,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,But the mind behind all those words-
22880,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
22881,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
22882,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
22883,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
22884,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Royce,"The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
22885,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
22886,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
22887,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
22888,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
22889,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
22890,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
22891,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
22892,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
22893,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,You never should have either.
22894,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,I thought he knew his sister.
22895,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,Families are complicated.
22896,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Ours certainly have been.
22897,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,A sad thing to have in common.
22898,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
22899,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
22900,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,"He loves you, you know that."
22901,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,That bothers you.
22902,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
22903,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"All my life, I've known one goal"
22904,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
22905,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
22906,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,Who was the first?
22907,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Someone taller.
22908,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
22909,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,I take the Iron Throne.
22910,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
22911,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Wolkan,"Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
22912,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,What is it?
22913,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Theon Greyjoy,My queen.
22914,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Your sister?
22915,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Theon Greyjoy,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
22916,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,But why aren't you with her?
22917,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Theon Greyjoy,"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
22918,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Man,"Milord, we're not soldiers."
22919,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
22920,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Man,Thank you.
22921,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gilly,"When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
22922,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gilly,They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
22923,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Woman,Thank you.
22924,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Teela,Which way should I go?
22925,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,Which way do you want to go?
22926,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Teela,All the children will be going below when the time comes.
22927,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Teela,But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
22928,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gilly,"That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
22929,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,I'm sure a lot of people would.
22930,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Teela,"All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
22931,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,My little crow.
22932,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,I thought we'd lost you.
22933,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,Almost.
22934,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,How did you find each other?
22935,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Edd,We met up at the Last Hearth.
22936,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,The dead got there first.
22937,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,The Umbers?
22938,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Beric,Fighting for the Night King now.
22939,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
22940,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,How long do we have?
22941,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
22942,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,The big woman still here?
22943,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,They're coming.
22944,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
22945,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,But there are too many of them.
22946,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Far too many.
22947,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Our enemy doesn't tire.
22948,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
22949,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
22950,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"So, what can we do?"
22951,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
22952,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
22953,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,"Yes, he will."
22954,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,"He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
22955,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,Why? What does he want?
22956,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,"An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
22957,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
22958,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,How will he find you?
22959,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,His mark is on me.
22960,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,He always knows where I am.
22961,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
22962,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
22963,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa Stark,You want us to use you as bait?
22964,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,We're not leaving you alone out there.
22965,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Theon Greyjoy,He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
22966,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
22967,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
22968,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
22969,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
22970,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
22971,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
22972,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
22973,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Dragonfire will stop him?
22974,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,I don't know. No one's ever tried.
22975,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,We're all going to die.
22976,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,But at least we die together.
22977,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Let's get some rest.
22978,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Your Grace.
22979,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Do you need help?
22980,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,No.
22981,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,You've had a strange journey.
22982,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,Stranger than most.
22983,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I'd like to hear about it.
22984,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Bran Stark,It's a long story.
22985,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
22986,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Missandei,Hello.
22987,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Grey Worm,"When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
22988,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Missandei,Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
22989,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Grey Worm,Then I will take you there.
22990,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Missandei,My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
22991,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Grey Worm,My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
22992,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,Have you told her yet?
22993,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,No.
22994,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
22995,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Edd,And now our watch begins.
22996,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Gilly? Little Sam?
22997,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,They'll be safe down in the crypt.
22998,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,If you want to join them.
22999,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,To protect them.
23000,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
23001,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Edd,Thenn.
23002,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,"I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
23003,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Edd,"Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
23004,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,"Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
23005,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Edd,Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
23006,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
23007,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Now it's just us three.
23008,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Edd,"Last man left, burn the rest of us."
23009,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I wish Father were here.
23010,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
23011,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,That would be something to see.
23012,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
23013,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Mm.
23014,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
23015,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
23016,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I was speaking in relative terms.
23017,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Do you miss it?
23018,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Of course I miss it.
23019,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
23020,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
23021,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,The perils of self-betterment.
23022,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Oh! My lady.
23023,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
23024,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
23025,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,"Thank you, milord."
23026,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,I don't think that's wise.
23027,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,The battle might start at any moment.
23028,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,Half cup.
23029,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,And you?
23030,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
23031,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
23032,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,All right. Just a bit.
23033,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,"Well, what do we have here?"
23034,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"Ser Davos, join us."
23035,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,"No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
23036,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
23037,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,"It could be our last night in this world, you know."
23038,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,"Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
23039,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
23040,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Would you like a drink?
23041,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,Brought my own.
23042,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,"They call you ""King Killer."""
23043,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I'm sure someone does.
23044,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,"They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
23045,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
23046,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,"When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
23047,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,Maybe I will have that drink.
23048,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
23049,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Guess I've changed.
23050,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,What are you doing up here?
23051,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,What's it look like?
23052,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
23053,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,"I fought for you, didn't I?"
23054,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,"Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
23055,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Beric,My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
23056,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,Was he on your list?
23057,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,For a little while.
23058,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Beric,That's all right.
23059,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Beric,The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
23060,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,"Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
23061,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sandor,Where are you going?
23062,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
23063,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,That for me?
23064,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,This'll work.
23065,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
23066,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,What did the Red Woman want with you?
23067,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
23068,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Why your blood?
23069,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
23070,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
23071,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Was that your first time?
23072,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
23073,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Your first time with a woman.
23074,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
23075,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
23076,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,Or after?
23077,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,You don't remember?
23078,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"Yes, I was."
23079,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,One? Two? Twenty?
23080,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"Well, I didn't keep count."
23081,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,"Yes, you did."
23082,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,Three.
23083,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
23084,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gendry Baratheon,"Arya, I-"
23085,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Arya Stark,I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
23086,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
23087,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,At least we'll die with honor.
23088,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I think we might live.
23089,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
23090,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,All without a shred of combat ability.
23091,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
23092,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
23093,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
23094,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
23095,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,Women can't be knights.
23096,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,Why not?
23097,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,Tradition.
23098,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,Fuck tradition.
23099,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne,I don't even want to be a knight.
23100,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,"I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over."
23101,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
23102,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,I'll prove it.
23103,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Kneel, Lady Brienne."
23104,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
23105,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
23106,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
23107,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
23108,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
23109,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
23110,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,We have all we need to win this war.
23111,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Lyanna,"I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again."
23112,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,"Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
23113,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Lyanna,I don't need you to remind me of that.
23114,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
23115,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Lyanna,"I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight."
23116,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
23117,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Lyann,It's all right. We're done here.
23118,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Lyanna,"I wish you good fortune, cousin."
23119,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,"Thank you, my lady."
23120,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,What have you got there?
23121,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
23122,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,You still have a family.
23123,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,"Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
23124,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jorah Mormont,I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
23125,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,I'll see you when it's through.
23126,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sam Tarly,I hope we win.
23127,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jaime Lannister,We'd better get some rest.
23128,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,"No, let's stay a bit longer."
23129,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,We're out of wine.
23130,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
23131,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Davos,You'll pray for a quick death.
23132,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Ser Brienne?
23133,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund,Mm-mm.
23134,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tyrion Lannister,Mmm.
23135,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,"High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most."
23136,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,The ones who'd been gone for so very long.
23137,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.
23138,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave
23139,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
23140,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick,Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
23141,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Who's that?
23142,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Lyanna Stark.
23143,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
23144,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,He didn't. He loved her.
23145,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
23146,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
23147,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,That's impossible.
23148,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,I wish it were.
23149,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,Who told you this?
23150,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,Bran. He saw it.
23151,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,He saw it?
23152,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
23153,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
23154,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon Snow,"It's true, Dany. I know it is."
23155,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Daenerys Targaryen,"If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."
23156,2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Man,Form up! Get yourselves back!
23157,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Northman,Oi!
23158,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Northman,Mind out.
23159,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Northman,MOVE!
23160,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Northman,"Look, on the west wall!"
23161,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Get down to the crypt!
23162,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Just hold.
23163,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Man,We'll take him.
23164,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Lyanna,"Come on, help the lads!"
23165,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"Yes, my lady."
23166,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Lyanna,"Quickly, now! Quickly! Get those in position."
23167,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Come on.
23168,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Close the gate!
23169,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,That's it.
23170,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Edd,"Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time."
23171,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,Do you speak their tongue?
23172,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,Tell them to lift their swords.
23173,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,Valar morghulis.
23174,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Grey Worm,Valar dohaeris.
23175,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Davos,Open the gate!
23176,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Open the gate!
23177,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Man,Come. Come on. Easy.
23178,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,"There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn."
23179,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Cease fire!
23180,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jon Snow,The Night King is coming.
23181,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Daenerys Targaryen,The dead are already here.
23182,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Brienne,Stand your ground!
23183,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,Get down to the crypt.
23184,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,I'm not abandoning my people.
23185,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,Take this and go.
23186,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,I don't know how to use it.
23187,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,Stick them with the pointy end.
23188,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sam Tarly,Edd! Edd!
23189,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Edd,"Sam, get up!"
23190,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Edd,"Oh, God. Sam."
23191,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Woman,Edd!
23192,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tormund,Fall back! Fall back!

23198,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Lyanna,"Keep moving, fast!"
23199,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,To your posts!
23200,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Go!
23201,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"Come on, run! Keep moving!"

23206,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Guard the barricades!
23207,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Through that pass!
23208,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Brienne,Hey! Hey! Hey!
23209,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Close up the gaps!
23210,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Brienne,Go! Hey! Go! Go!
23211,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!
23212,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Move!
23213,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Retreat!

23217,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sandor Clegane,Fall back!
23218,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Grey Worm,Light the trench! Light the trench!
23219,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Wait!
23220,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Light the trench!
23221,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Davos,She can't see us.
23222,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Davos,Light the trenches!
23223,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"With a torch, light the trenches! Right there."
23224,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Torch it!
23225,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,"Lord of Light, cast your light upon us. Lord of Light, defend us. For the night is dark and full of terrors!"
23226,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,"Lord of Light, cast your light upon us! Lord of Light, defend us! For the night is dark and full of terrors!"
23227,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,Clegane.
23228,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Woman,You must try not to worry yourself.
23229,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Varys,At least we're already in a crypt.
23230,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,"If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
23231,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
23232,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Varys,And got your face cut in half.
23233,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
23234,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,You'd die. There's nothing you can do.
23235,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
23236,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,"Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face."
23237,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,Maybe we should have stayed married.
23238,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,You were the best of them.
23239,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,What a terrifying thought.
23240,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,It wouldn't work between us.
23241,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,Why not?
23242,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sansa Stark,The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
23243,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Missandei,"Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already."
23244,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Theon Greyjoy,They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did
23245,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Bran Stark,Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.
23246,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Bran Stark,I'm going to go now.
23247,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Theon Greyjoy,Go where?
23248,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Davos,Man the walls!
23249,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Man the walls!
23250,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Man the wall!
23251,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Lyanna,Man the walls! Come on!
23252,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Lyanna,Get out there! Get moving!
23253,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,"Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!"
23254,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Brienne,Come on!
23255,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,They're against the wall!
23256,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Get more men up here!
23257,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"Fill the gaps, quickly!"
23258,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Get in there!
23259,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,They're climbing the walls!
23260,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Relieve the archers!
23261,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Relieve the archers!
23262,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Archers on top!
23263,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Move up!
23264,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"Go, go! Come here! Come on!"
23265,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Move back!
23266,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Stand away!
23267,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"Go on, go on."
23268,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jorah Mormont,Go! Go.
23269,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Step back.
23270,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"All the way, archers!"
23271,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Hold the wall!
23272,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,"The wall, they're coming up!"
23273,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Draw!
23274,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Come on!
23275,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,They're coming up!
23276,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jaime Lannister,Look out!
23277,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,Clegane! Clegane!
23278,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,"Clegane! Clegane, we need you!"
23279,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,You can't give up on us.
23280,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sandor Clegane,"Fuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death."
23281,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,Tell her that.
23282,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Open the door!
23283,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Soldier,Open the door! Open the door! Please! Open it!
23284,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sandor Clegane,Come on!
23285,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,Go!
23286,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Beric,Run!
23287,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Sandor Clegane,We've gotta go!
23288,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,The Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.
23289,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,I know you.
23290,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,And I know you.
23291,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,You said we'd meet again.
23292,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,And here we are. At the end of the world.
23293,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.
23294,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,Brown eyes... green eyes... and blue eyes.
23295,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Melisandre,What do we say to the God of Death?
23296,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Arya Stark,Not today.
23297,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Theon Greyjoy,Here they come!
23298,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Theon Greyjoy,"Steady, lads."
23299,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Theon Greyjoy,Steady now. Make every shot count.
23300,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Man,Over there!
23301,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Man,There!
23302,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jon Snow,Get off!
23303,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Daenerys Targaryen,Dracarys.
23304,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Tyrion Lannister,"Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!"
23305,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jon Snow,Bran!
23306,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Daenerys Targaryen,Go!
23307,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Daenerys Targaryen,Jorah!
23308,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Bran Stark,Theon.
23309,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Bran Stark,You're a good man.
23310,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Bran Stark,Thank you.
23311,2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,Jorah Mormont,I'm hurt.
23312,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Jon Snow,We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
23313,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Man,To your health.
23314,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,Have you seen Arya?
23315,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Sandor Clegane,"You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at."
23316,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,I just want to thank her for-
23317,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Sandor Clegane,I'm sure you do.
23318,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,"Look, it's not about that."
23319,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Sandor Clegane,"Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not."
23320,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,Gendry.
23321,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,"That's right, isn't it?"
23322,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,"Yes, Your Grace."
23323,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,You're Robert Baratheon's son.
23324,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
23325,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.
23326,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"
23327,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,"I don't know, Your Grace."
23328,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,Does anyone?
23329,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
23330,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Gendry Baratheon,I can't be. I'm a bastard.
23331,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,"No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."
23332,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Davos,To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.
23333,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,All,To Gendry!
23334,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Man,Lord Gendry!
23335,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Man,Gendry!
23336,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Man,"That's easy, isn't it?"
23337,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,A fitting reward for a hero.
23338,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Sam,"Uh, hold on."
23339,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
23340,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Man,"Come, my lord."
23341,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Daenerys Targaryen,See? You're not the only one who's clever.
23342,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Woman,I have to go down and get another barrel.
23343,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Jaime Lannister,"We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
23344,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Davos,"The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
23345,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,I'm sure you had your reasons.
23346,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Davos,I did. I do.
23347,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,So did you?
23348,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Davos,"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
23349,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
23350,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Davos,And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
23351,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
23352,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Davos,Thank you. I feel much better.
23353,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Man,More ale!
23354,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
23355,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Bran Stark,It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
23356,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
23357,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Bran Stark,I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
23358,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
23359,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,You don't want it.
23360,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Bran Stark,I don't really want anymore.
23361,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Tyrion Lannister,I envy you.
23362,2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,Bran Stark,You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.
23363,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,Come in.
23364,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,And?
23365,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,Nothing?
23366,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Martha,She won't eat.
23367,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,We'll try again at supper.
23368,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Martha,I think they're watching me.
23369,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,Who?
23370,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Martha,Her soldiers.
23371,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,Of course they are. That's their job.
23372,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,"What have I told you, Martha?"
23373,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Martha,"The greater the risk, the greater the reward."
23374,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
23375,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,The Northern armies?
23376,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
23377,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
23378,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,She shouldn't be alone.
23379,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
23380,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,Aren't you worried for her?
23381,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
23382,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
23383,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,We both know what she's about to do.
23384,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
23385,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
23386,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,What do you want?
23387,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
23388,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,I don't want it. I never have.
23389,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
23390,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,She is my queen.
23391,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Your Grace?
23392,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,There's something you need to know.
23393,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Someone has betrayed me.
23394,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Yes.
23395,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Jon Snow.
23396,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Varys.
23397,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,He knows the truth about Jon.
23398,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,He does.
23399,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
23400,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
23401,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,And Varys?
23402,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
23403,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
23404,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,It was a mistake.
23405,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
23406,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,She trusts me.
23407,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
23408,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
23409,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,But it doesn't matter now.
23410,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,No. It doesn't matter now.
23411,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,It was me.
23412,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Varys,"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
23413,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
23414,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,sentence you to die. Dracarys.
23415,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
23416,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
23417,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
23418,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
23419,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
23420,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,I love you. And you will always be my queen.
23421,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
23422,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"All right, then."
23423,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Let it be fear.
23424,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
23425,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
23426,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
23427,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
23428,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
23429,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
23430,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"I beg you, my queen-"
23431,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
23432,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
23433,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
23434,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
23435,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
23436,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Daenerys Targaryen,It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
23437,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Guard,Let them pass.
23438,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Guard,Through the gate.
23439,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Guard,Get going.
23440,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Davos,The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
23441,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,She wants to attack now.
23442,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jon Snow,Daybreak at the earliest.
23443,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Careful with that.
23444,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,My lord.
23445,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
23446,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Davos,"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
23447,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,He's always better when he's got some food in him.
23448,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?
23449,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.
23450,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Ay up. Where you going?
23451,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Arya Stark,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
23452,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Sandor Clegane,"Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow."
23453,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,I need to go talk to my captain.
23454,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Sandor Clegane,"Go ahead, talk to him."
23455,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Where's he going?
23456,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,I drink to eat the skull keeper.
23457,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,I want to eat the skull keeper.
23458,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,I want to see the ...
23459,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Unsullied,We speak the common tongue.
23460,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
23461,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Unsullied,We have orders to guard the prisoner.
23462,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
23463,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Unsullied,No.
23464,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
23465,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,How did they find you?
23466,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Did you consider taking it off?
23467,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
23468,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"And you're going back to her, to die with her."
23469,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,You've underestimated her before.
23470,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
23471,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,Difficult to do from here.
23472,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
23473,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
23474,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
23475,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
23476,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
23477,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
23478,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
23479,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,The city will fall tomorrow.
23480,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
23481,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
23482,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
23483,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Why?
23484,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
23485,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
23486,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
23487,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,Swear to me.
23488,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,You have my word.
23489,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
23490,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,I'll try.
23491,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
23492,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,Your queen will execute you for this.
23493,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
23494,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
23495,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Jaime Lannister,You would have.
23496,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
23497,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Eyes on the horizon!
23498,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Load the scorpion!
23499,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,"Archers, close up!"
23500,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Man,Come on!
23501,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Up to the espringal!
23502,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,To the back of it!
23503,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,"Archers, line up!"
23504,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Woman,This way! Come on!
23505,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Clear the streets now!
23506,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Woman,No!
23507,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Man,"In, now. And you, come on."
23508,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,"Inside, now!"
23509,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Man,Quickly.
23510,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.
23511,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Father,My son!
23512,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Get inside!
23513,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Man,"Just ahead of you, I can see it!"
23514,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,"All right, move it!"
23515,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Woman,Come on!
23516,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Keep moving!
23517,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Keep going!
23518,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Quickly!
23519,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,All the way!
23520,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Father,Hold your mother's hand!
23521,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Make way for the Golden Company!
23522,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,Close the gate!
23523,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Tyrion Lannister,"If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men."
23524,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,"Move along now, lads."
23525,2019-05-12,Season 8,Episode 5,The Bells,Soldier,That's it.

23679,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,They are breathing.
23680,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,"Look around you, friend. We won."
23681,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,"I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
23682,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,And what are the queen's commands?
23683,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,"Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."

23685,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,Jon. We should speak with the queen.
23686,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,Blood of my blood.
23687,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.

23689,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,Torgo Nudho.
23690,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,"You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
23691,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
23692,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
23693,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,"From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
23694,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,Will you break the wheel with me?
23695,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
23696,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
23697,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,Take him.
23698,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,What are you doing here?
23699,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"Hey, what happened?"
23700,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
23701,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,She's everyone's queen now.
23702,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,Try telling Sansa.
23703,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
23704,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
23705,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Did you bring any wine?
23706,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,No.
23707,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
23708,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,So is there life after death?
23709,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Not that I've seen.
23710,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
23711,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,You didn't.
23712,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
23713,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
23714,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
23715,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
23716,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
23717,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
23718,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
23719,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
23720,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Cersei left her no choice.
23721,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
23722,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
23723,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,And she burned down a city for it.
23724,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
23725,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Would you have done it?
23726,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,What?
23727,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
23728,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I don't know.
23729,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
23730,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,What's it matter what I'd do?
23731,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
23732,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
23733,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
23734,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Love is the death of duty.
23735,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,You just came up with that?
23736,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
23737,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
23738,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
23739,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,That's her decision. She is the queen.
23740,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I'm sorry it came to this.
23741,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
23742,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
23743,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
23744,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,She doesn't get to choose.
23745,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
23746,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
23747,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
23748,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,It was necessary.
23749,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
23750,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
23751,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,And Tyrion?
23752,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
23753,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Forgive him.
23754,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,I can't.
23755,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
23756,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"Please, Dany."
23757,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
23758,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
23759,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
23760,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
23761,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
23762,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I don't.
23763,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,You do. You do. You've always known.
23764,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
23765,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,They don't get to choose.
23766,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Daenerys Targaryen,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
23767,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"You are my queen. Now, and always."
23768,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,Where's Jon?
23769,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,He is our prisoner.
23770,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
23771,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
23772,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,"If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
23773,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
23774,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Yara Greyjoy,Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
23775,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,You swore to follow a tyrant.
23776,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Yara Greyjoy,"She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
23777,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
23778,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
23779,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,"If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
23780,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
23781,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,It's not for you to decide.
23782,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
23783,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
23784,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Maester Wolkan,We don't have a king or queen.
23785,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
23786,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,"Make your choice, then."
23787,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Edmure,My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-
23788,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,Uncle? Please sit.
23789,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Maester Wolkan,"Well, we have to choose someone."
23790,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,Why just us?
23791,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
23792,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Edmure,Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
23793,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Yohn Royce,I'll ask my horse.
23794,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Edmure,I suppose you want the crown.
23795,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Me? The Imp?
23796,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
23797,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Can't think of a worse choice.
23798,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,"Who, then?"
23799,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
23800,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
23801,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
23802,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
23803,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
23804,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
23805,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,Why do you think I came all this way?
23806,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
23807,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,Aye.
23808,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Edmure,Aye.
23809,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Riverlands Lord,Aye.
23810,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Yohn Royce,Aye.
23811,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Maester Wolkan,Aye.
23812,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Robin,Aye.
23813,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Dornish Prince,Aye.
23814,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Yara Greyjoy,Aye.
23815,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Ironborn Lord,Aye.
23816,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Vale Lord,Aye.
23817,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Gendry Baratheon,Aye.
23818,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,"I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
23819,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Brienne,Aye.
23820,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
23821,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
23822,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,All,All hail Bran the Broken!
23823,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,"Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."
23824,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
23825,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,And I don't want to be king.
23826,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
23827,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,I choose you.
23828,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,You cannot.
23829,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,"Yes, I can. I'm king."
23830,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
23831,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
23832,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,It is not enough.
23833,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
23834,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,There's still a Night's Watch?
23835,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
23836,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
23837,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Was it right? What I did?
23838,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,What we did.
23839,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,It doesn't feel right.
23840,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Ask me again in ten years.
23841,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
23842,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
23843,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Unsullied Captain,All the men have boarded.
23844,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Grey Worm,Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
23845,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
23846,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"The North is free, thanks to you."
23847,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,But they lost their king.
23848,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
23849,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,"You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
23850,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,I can't.
23851,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
23852,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,I'm not going back north.
23853,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sansa Stark,Where are you going?
23854,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,What's west of Westeros?
23855,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
23856,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,You have your Needle?
23857,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Arya Stark,Right here.
23858,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,Your Grace.
23859,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
23860,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
23861,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,That's not- Uh-
23862,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,What's this?
23863,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
23864,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
23865,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
23866,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed."
23867,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,He's not kind?
23868,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,He-
23869,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,He what? What does he say about me?
23870,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
23871,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Your Grace.
23872,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,Your Grace.
23873,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,Your Grace.
23874,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,Your Grace.
23875,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
23876,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
23877,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,And Drogon? Any word?
23878,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,"He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
23879,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,"The farther away, the better."
23880,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
23881,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"As you wish, Your Grace."
23882,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Brienne,Ser Podrick.
23883,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
23884,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,Long may he reign.
23885,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,Long may he reign.
23886,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Brienne,Long may he reign.
23887,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,Long may he reign.
23888,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,That will improve.
23889,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bran Stark,I'm sure it will.
23890,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
23891,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,"In full, my lord Hand."
23892,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
23893,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,Indeed we can.
23894,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
23895,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
23896,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
23897,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Davos,Any more.
23898,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,You Master of Grammar now too?
23899,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
23900,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
23901,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,The strong live and the weak don't.
23902,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,Find the best builders and set them to the task.
23903,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
23904,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Sam,Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
23905,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
23906,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Brienne,I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
23907,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Bronn,I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
23908,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion Lannister,I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
23909,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,Man,The Queen in the North!
23910,2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,All,The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!
